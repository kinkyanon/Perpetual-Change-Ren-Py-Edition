                     [Eclair]Yeah, yeah. Just need to make a pit stop before something
                     goes wrong.
                     [Marie]Like what?
                     [Eclair]Never mind, just keep your eyes peeled for a bathroom.

                     doing the uhh…potty dance?
                     [Eclair]Yeah. I guess I am. I’m having a bit of an emergency here.
                     [Marie]It’s cool if…y’know. Mishelle does it all the time.
                     [Eclair]Yeah, but I’m not Mishelle.

                     wear skirts. I didn’t mean to embarrass you. Sorry.

                     [Eclair](Not again!)
                     [Eclair]Oof!
                     []\iOut of nowhere Eclair’s bladder feels as full as it’s ever felt.
                     Where did that come from? A bead of sweat rolls down her
                     forehead as she searches for a toilet almost instinctually.\i
                     []\iThe slight crinkle and extra padding between her legs reminds
                     her that she has other options beyond a mad dash. Eclair feels
                     temptation. But no. Not yet.\i
                     [Eclair]It’s okay. It’s okay. Got plenty of time. Just gotta find a
                     bathroom is all.
                     []\iAnother cascade of bodily fluids escapes Eclair and gushes
                     out onto her already ruined clothes. The diaper she’s wearing
                     is functionally no different than regular panties at this point.\i
                     []\iEclair doesn’t feel like a little kid anymore. Now she’s just
                     a grown woman who’s pissed her pants.\i
                     []\iEclair is almost relaxed as she pees into the already overly
                     saturated diaper.  Any relief her body might feel doesn’t last
                     as the wet warmth beings to spread and flow outward onto\i
                     []\iher clothes. The pee trickles down her legs and stains her
                     socks while a puddle forms at her feet.\i
                     [Eclair]What?! What do I do now?!
                     []\iThe warm wet sensation between Eclair’s legs spreads and
                     creeps up to her backside, leaving her feeling wet and squishy
                     all over.The stench of large amounts of urine waft up to her nose.\i
                     []\iEclair feels the diaper begin to sag with the added weight of
                     another accident. The crinkle in her movement is almost
                     completely muted and replaced with a soft squish coming
                     from her thighs.\i
                     [Eclair](Wow! This thing can hold a lot!)
                     []\iThe feeling of another dose of urine sloshing around in her
                     plastic underwear makes Eclair blush. The diaper is close
                     to bursting, now. She can feel the added bulk of the diaper,\i
                     []\iheavy with her pee sashaying between her thighs. There’s
                     something that feels excitingly perverse about urinating in
                     an already wet diaper. Anyone can wet their pants, once,\i
                     []\iand then change. The fact that she was in this diaper long
                     enough to use it twice makes her feel particularly naughty.\i
                     [Eclair]Hehehehehe.
                     []\iHot pee bursts out of Eclair and into the thirsty padding confining
                     her. A warm wetness spreads along her crotch.  An intense hiss
                     fills her ears. Her bladder sings out in relief while the blood\i
                     []\irushes to her face. Eclair has wet her panties. And though
                     she won’t admit it, she feels a kind of mental relief, too.\i
                     [Eclair]*long inaudible sigh*
                     []\iToo late! The rational part of Eclair’s psyche realizes this
                     as her bladder gives out. Her knees lock. Her arms go
                     rigid. Her bladder empties its contents completely.\i
                     []\iThe spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. Seeing no other
                     option, Eclair just closes her eyes, takes a deep breath,
                     and does what she can to enjoy it a bit.\i
                     []\iA soft gasp escapes her lips as her diaper warms and
                     crisp stiff padding becomes wet and squishy.\i
                     [Eclair]Mmmmmmm...

                               [Maxwell]*sighs* I know. Career day.

                               [Maxwell]Yeah, I get that. But my dad will answer all of the
                               questions you need to know.
                               Why bother going all over the island when you can be
                               done with the assignment in a snap?

                               folksy bit like you do for the tourists.
                               [Glenn]Oh, phew. That’s a relief.
                               Hey kids. Career Day?
                               [Eclair]Yes, sir.
                               [Mishelle]You got it.
                               [Vince]Yup.
                               [Glenn]I’m guessing you guys just want me to tell you how
                               all the things on the island work like Maxwell.
                               [Eclair]No, actually.
                               [Glenn]Oh really?  *Smiles*  Then, do you kids want to see
                               something really cool?
                               [Eclair]Sure!
                               [Glenn]Okie dokie. But first you have to do something for me.
                               Help me clean up the farm.
                               Find three pieces of trash for me around the farm, one
                               for each of you, and meet me by the corn maze.
                               [Vince]So you’re not going to help us unless we do chores
                               for you?
                               [Maxwell]Oooooh! I know this one! Trust me, guys. This’ll be
                               worth it.
                               [Mishelle]Does that mean you’ll help us pick stuff up, Maxwell?
                               [Maxwell]I woooouuld…but I might get so excited I’d give away
                               the surprise.
                               [Eclair]You’re not trying to “Tom Sawyer” us are you?
                               [Maxwell]Tom saw your what?
                               [Eclair]It’s from a book. It’s literally older than the internet.
                               [Mishelle]She means are you trying to trick us into doing your
                               chores for you.
                               [Maxwell]Oh no no no no no!
                               [Glenn]Maybe a little.
                               [Maxwell]But it’ll still be cool.

                               [Eclair]Just killing some time, Mr. Hanners.
                               [Glenn]Is something going on at school today. My girls seemed like
                               they were up to some kind of mischief early this morning. I’d
                               expect that from Carmella, but Maxwell?
                               [Eclair]Oh…that. I’m sure they’ll explain it better than I possibly could.

55)  EV: 22 / Pg: 3            [Maxwell]You guys are doing this Career Day thing all wrong.
                               [Eclair]We’re supposed to go an ask people around the

                               [Maxwell]But why bother if you can find the info all from one
                               source?
                               [Eclair]Yeah, but what if you get caught?
                               [Maxwell]How am I going to get caught? I’ll still know all the
                               answers, so who cares? Why read the book when you
                               can just watch the movie?
                               [Eclair]You know how everyone seems to know about Career
                               Day? What if Miss Georgette goes and asks who from
                               our class actually showed up.
                               [Maxwell]I…I…well, crap. *Shrugs* Oh well, Too late now.

                               of like a wave or something.
                               [Mishelle]Uh…we’re in the ocean.

37)  EV: 3 / Pg: 3             [Eclair]Granny, why does everyone call you Granny?
                               [Granny Vicenza]Oh that’s an easy one, dearie. It’s because I’m old,
                               but being called “Granny” is so much nicer than
                               being called “Ma’am”.
                               [Eclair]That’s all?
                               [Granny Vicenza]That’s all.
                               [Eclair]Do you have any real grandkids?
                               [Granny Vicenza]Everyone on the island is my grandchild, dearie and
                               I love them all just the same.
                               Just because I never settled down and had children
                               myself, doesn’t mean they’re any less my “real”
                               grandchildren.
                               [Eclair]I suppose that’s true. Why didn’t you ever have kids?
                               [Granny Vicenza]Well, there was a certain special someone.
                               [Eclair]Who?
                               [Granny Vicenza]I…I honestly can’t remember, anymore. That’s odd.
                               I normally have such a good memory. I don’t even
                               remember his name, anymore.
                               [Eclair]I’m sorry, Granny. I didn’t mean to make you sad.
                               [Granny Vicenza]Oh, I’m not sad, dearie. I have no regrets about my life.
                               I get to be everyone’s Granny, now. Everyone smiles at
                               me, and is happy to see me.I get to make everyone’s
                               day a little better, just by being me.
                               And at the end of the day, they all go home, and I get
                               to have my nice quiet evenings; and in the morning,
                               it’s time to smile and have fun again.

                               [Granny Vicenza]Oh plenty has, dearie, plenty has. We didn’t even
                               have Career Day when I was your age.
                               [Eclair]Oh, really? Why?
                               [Granny Vicenza]Well, Mayor Knox likes to brag about Dr. Milner’s
                               grand plans for turning this island into a paradise,
                               but that wasn’t always the case.
                               [Mishelle]What was the case, then?
                               [Granny Vicenza]Originally the entire island of Farzon was
                               supposed to be just a mining town.
                               [Vince]But the mines are abandoned.
                               [Granny Vicenza]Yes, but they haven’t always been. I was just a young
                               girl, about, I want to say, Marie’s age, maybe a little
                               younger, when my family moved here.
                               They were miners. Dr. Milner had bought the island
                               and the mine and had the port and the lighthouse
                               built for the ships to transport supplies.
                               Apparently there was some precious resource that
                               Dr. Milner wanted.  I never knew if it was gold, or
                               diamonds, or even something as simple as coal.
                               But my family, like so many others, came to work in
                               the mines. It was a different place then.
                               It wasn’t nearly as nice, but then again, no one had
                               planned on living here for more than a few years.
                               [Mishelle]What happened? Why did everybody stay?
                               [Granny Vicenza]I remember going to visit my parents at work one
                               day, and Dr. Milner came to visit. Apparently one of the
                               miners had found something and everyone was very
                               excited by it. All I know is that Dr. Milner walked into
                               the mine shaking his head and shouting. When he
                               came out, he looked both scared and happy; like
                               he had just seen a ghost and won the lottery all at
                               once. The mine was closed the very next day.
                               [Vince]Your parents got laid off?
                               [Granny Vicenza]Oh my stars and garters, dearie, no. Quite the
                               opposite, in fact. Dr. Milner invested even more
                               money into the island.
                               Miners just became construction workers. First they
                               built the Observatory that Karlton works in. Then the
                               Nursery was built, with the school close behind.
                               The company supply store became the General Store
                               where the Sayers work. Then came the café and all
                               the shops.
                               A strip mine town turned into a real community.
                               [Mishelle]What did Dr. Harkness Milner find?
                               [Granny Vicenza]I don’t know, dearie.  But whatever it was inspired
                               Dr. Milner to start inventing. Most of our islands great
                               advancements are because of his work.
                               [Eclair]So all the cool stuff on the island was invented
                               by Dr. Milner?
                               [Granny Vicenza]Most of it, yes. Nanobots, medicine, mechanical
                               helpers, alternative energy sources, the IA’s.
                               [Eclair]All because of what he found in the mine?
                               [Granny Vicenza]I suspect so. He went from being a miser to being a
                               little like Santa Claus. Then again, when you think
                               about all the money he made from his inventions, he
                               could afford to be jolly. Maybe you should go to the
                               mine, have yourselves a little adventure?
                               [Eclair]I don’t think Ranger Michael would be too
                               keen on that.
                               [Mishelle]He pretty much forbids anybody going near there.
                               [Granny Vicenza]Does he now? I seem to remember a little boy who
                               liked to wander around the old digging sites and mine
                               entrances looking for bats and such.
                               That boy always did have a thing for wildlife. You go on
                               ahead and find Ranger Michael dearies. Granny will
                               be along to help.
                               [Eclair, Mishelle, Vince]Thanks Granny!
                               [C.S.]Don’t even think about it.

                               [Mayor Knox]Karlton? It’s the Mayor. How are the preparations going
                               for the big harvest?
                               [Karlton]Most productive, sir. Most productive.
                               [Mayor Knox]And have the boys in the control room notified us of
                               who the lucky tribute is?
                               [Karlton]Actually sir, there was no need this time. I happened to
                               come across all three of them in my lab just the other day.
                               [Mayor Knox]Three?
                               [Eclair](Three!)
                               [Karlton]Coincidentally they just so happen to walk in right as
                               I finished inventing my expectacles.
                               [Eclair](Eeeep! He’s talking about me!)
                               [Mayor Knox]Three viable tributes? All affected by the pulses? But
                               how is that even possible?
                               [Karlton]Well sir, if you had bothered to read my paper on parallel
                               universe theory and probability….according to the Biff
                               Tannen postulate-
                               [Mayor Knox]Never mind all that, that’s not important right now!
                               [Karlton]But sir…Science…
                               [Mayor Knox]Will all three be ready to harvest?
                               [Karlton]The boys assure me that two of them are proceeding
                               exactly as planned.
                               [Mayor Knox]And the third?
                               [Karlton]For some reason they get distracted and change the
                               subject whenever I ask.
                               [Mayor Knox]Well never mind that, let’s think with a little practicality, shall we?
                               [Karlton]A little what?
                               [Mayor Knox]Should we use our sudden windfall to further our technology
                               even faster? Or should we use it as a kind of advance so
                               that we won’t need another harvest for the next thirty years?
                               [Karlton]By logic, I don’t know. I suppose that’s why you’re the Mayor, sir.
                               [Eclair](They want to harvest me! They want to harvest me!
                               What does that even mean?!)

                               died…or…or
                               [Eclair](Oh no! I’ve been found out!)
                               [Secretary]Sir…ugh...
                               [Secretary]Can I please be excused and leave work early please?
                               [Mayor Knox]Goodness gracious woman! Is that smell coming from you?
                               [Secretary]Yes..ugh…sir.
                               [Secretary]Think I poisoned myself with some bad…ugh…

                               [Secretary]The line was…ugh…busy sir.
                               [Eclair](Now’s my chance! Gotta get to the elevator)
                               [Mayor Knox]If you’re feeling that ill, then yes, please, get out of here!
                               [Secretary]Thank you, sir.
                               [Secretary]Oh dear. Ugh…
                               [Eclair]So Mayor Knox knows something strange is going on!
                               I knew it!  He and Karlton want to harvest me and my
                               friends! But what could they be harvesting?
                               [Eclair]Oh no, I’m gonna be late for dinner!
                               [Eclair](Not worth my dignity!)
                               [Eclair]Phew...made it. And I’m about out of wipes too. No way
                               could I have cleaned up a mess like that in my diaper.
                               [Eclair]Who knows how Mom would’ve reacted if I had come
                               home for dinner in poopy pants. Good thing I don’t
                               have to worry.

                               [Little Girl]Isn't it nice to go to a school in the forest? Isn't it the
                               perfect place?

                               [Gamer Boy]Do you play video games? I do! I love them so much! I
                               wish I could be part of a game. Maybe i could be one
                               of the NPCs. Ooh! And give cool items to the hero!

57)  EV: 5 / Pg: 1             [Larry]Do you like my new hat?
                               [Larry]I can't believe no one has commented on my new hat.
                               I ordered it online. I know eBay has been barely used
                               for half a century, but there are some bargains there!

                               such a good mood today.
                               [Ms.Barnett]It is so good to see you. I hope you will come around

                               [Old Bob]I understand that you are already quite busy or I
                               would invite you to join us for some tea.

                               [Eclair]This dress is so pretty! How do I look?
                               [Richard]Cute as a button, baby! Cute as a button. Now watch the birdie!
                               [Eclair]Heh, heh. This is kind of fun.
                               [Richard]You bet it is! That’s what Innocence is all about! Having fun!
                               [Eclair]Hmm...what if I…?
                               [Richard]Oooh! Sucking your thumb! That’s great!
                               [Richard]You’re a natural, baby, a natural! Now turn around and
                               give me a little peak at that diaper! Atta girl!
                               [Richard]That’s right! Thatta girl! You’re adorable. You’re...you’re
                               [Eclair]Ooopsie! Tee-hee!
                               [Richard]Oh…oh…oh…geez. Did you really just?
                               [Eclair]*Playfully* I think I hadda accident.
                               [Richard]I think I’m in love.
                               [Eclair]Sorry, about that. I think I got a little too into character.
                               [Richard]No. We’re fine.*beings sweating* We’re totally fine.
                               [Eclair]You sure? You look like something’s bothering you.
                               [Richard]Nothing…nothing at all.
                               [Eclair]Oh! I see you’ve got a lot of extra diapers laying around for
                               the models that didn’t bring their own. Mind if I borrow one?
                               [Richard]Can…can…can…can I change you?
                               [Eclair]Don’t be ridiculous. I can change myself. I’m not
                               REALLY a baby, y’know?
                               [Richard]*Panting* Yeah…I know.  I’m gonna…need to take a little
                               walk. I’ve got everything I need.
                               [Eclair]Well, that was actually kind of fun. Glad I did it.
                               [Eclair]Well, that was actually kind of fun. Glad I did it.
                               [Eclair]Isn’t this dress a little…um…short?
                               [Richard]Not at all. It covers just enough of the diaper.
                               [Eclair]But you can still tell I’m wearing one.
                               [Richard]Exactly! That’s the whole theme of Innocence! You can
                               have the best of both worlds!
                               [Richard]Now don’t look so tense, or the readers won’t believe
                               you’re enjoying this!
                               [Eclair]But I’m not! (Why did I say yes to this?)
                               [Richard]Oh don’t be so fussy, baby girl.
                               [Eclair](What was I thinking? Glad that’s over.)









2)  EV: 7 / Pg: 1              [Eclair]Promised I’d meet Mishelle and Vince today before
                               school.


2)  EV: 8 / Pg: 1              []No mail today either.
                               []Aw, no mail today.



2)  EV: 4 / Pg: 1              [Eclair]She locked the door! Mom! Let me in!
                               [Vince]You okay, Eclair?
                               [Eclair]Guys! You can’t tell, can you?
                               [Mishelle]Tell what?
                               [Eclair]What I’m…I’m…wearing? I mean I know I checked it
                               out this morning, and it didn’t look too bad, but be
                               honest with me: Can you guys tell what I’m wearing?
                               [Vince]Is this a trick question?
                               [Eclair]I promise you it isn’t.
                               [Vince]Okay. Let’s see. Shirt, pants. Sneakers. Nothing seems...
                               [Mishelle]Don’t forget the diaper!
                               [Eclair]EEEEEP!
                               [Vince]MISHELLE!
                               [Mishelle]What? We all know she’s wearing them.
                               [Vince]Not the point! You know how she’s been lately!
                               Besides, she prefers the term “briefs”, remember?
                               [Mishelle]Oh yeah. Sorry Eclair, I meant “briefs”, when I was
                               talking about the diaper.
                               [Eclair]Can you see it?! Can you tell?
                               [Vince]Pfffttt. Of course not.
                               [Eclair]Then how…?
                               [Mishelle]Is she serious?
                               [Vince]She’s been weird lately.*To Eclair* Look, we’re just
                               going to school. If you want to come, feel free.
                               [Eclair](That sound!)
                               Guys! Wait!
                               Now go.
                               STOP!
                               [Vince]Eclair, what’s up with you?
                               [Mishelle]Yeah, you’re acting even weirder today than you were
                               yesterday.
                               [Eclair]Is…is that noise coming from you guys, too?
                               [Mishelle]What noise?
                               [Eclair]That crinkling noise. Are you guys wearing dia-…
                               wearing incontinence briefs too?
                               [Mishelle]Oh my god! How do you still notice that sound?
                               [Eclair]How do you NOT notice it?
                               [Mishelle]I don’t think I’ve really thought about it in forever. It’s like
                               the humming of a lightbulb. It’s just white noise.
                               [Eclair]But that doesn’t make any sense, Mishelle. We weren’t
                               wearing these yesterday.
                               [Vince]Okay, this has gotten older than the internet. I’m gone.
                               I’ll see you two at school if you’re coming.
                               [Eclair]Wait! Please!
                               [Eclair] Guys, I don’t know what’s going on. Everything seems
                               so backwards and out of whack today.
                               And I’ve had the weirdest dreams and everyone seems
                               to remember things differently than I do.
                               [Vince]Ugggh…this again. Eclair, you’re the one who’s been
                               acting strangely.
                               [Mishelle]Eclair, are you sure you’re okay?
                               [Eclair]Just tell me: Why aren’t we wearing regular underwear?
                               [Vince]Again?
                               [Eclair]Again?
                               [Mishelle]We had this same conversation yesterday, remember?
                               [Eclair]You mean about the…the soggy slumber parties?
                               [Mishelle]And the padded play-dates…
                               [Eclair]The padded what now?
                               [Vince]*Sighs* And all the other little euphemisms our parents
                               came up with for us playing together because we were
                               all pretty much incontinent.
                               [Mishelle]Yeah, that’s kind of how we started being friends.
                               Vince, it’s just us right now. You don’t have to be so
                               cross.
                               [Vince]She’s trolling us, Mishelle. She has to be.
                               [Eclair]I’m really not, I swear!
                               [Vince]Then why are you pretending like we haven’t been like
                               this since we’ve known each other?
                               [Mishelle]Yeah, we used to get changed right in front of each
                               other when we were little. Sometimes side by side.
                               Hey Vince, remember how we used to hold hands
                               while our parents were changing us?
                               [Vince]Yeah.
                               [Eclair]Vince, are you blushing?
                               [Mishelle]Oh you know Vince, he’s always been sooooo sensitive
                               about this stuff
                               [Vince]Mishelle…
                               [Mishelle]Like you ever notice how he never says “I’m gonna
                               go change”. It’s always something like “I’m gonna go
                               stretch my legs.”?
                               [Eclair]Um…I don’t actually.
                               [Vince]Mishelle…
                               [Mishelle]As if everybody doesn’t know. Why else would he need
                               to take his backpack with him when he walks out of
                               class to “stretch his legs”?
                               [Eclair]I have no idea-
                               [Vince]MISHELLE!
                               [Mishelle]Oh! Sorry.
                               [Mishelle]See what I mean?
                               [Eclair]I am so confused right now.
                               [Mishelle]It’s not like it’s a big secret, Eclair. We have a condition.
                               Everyone knows. And everyone is cool with it.
                               [Vince]Except Fiona.
                               [Mishelle]Well yeah, except for Fiona. She never has let go of
                               that whole “babies” thing, has she? But still, it’s not
                               like it’s a secret or a reason to be embarrassed.
                               I’m willing to bet that at least one of us is at least a little
                               wet right now. Right, Vince?
                               [Vince]I’m…gonna go stretch my legs real quick.
                               [Mishelle]I honestly think it’s a little harder on him.  It’s hard to
                               be the stoic, macho dude when you’re wearing diapers
                               all your life.
                               [Eclair]But he hasn’t…
                               [Mishelle]That time in kindergarten doesn’t really count.
                               [Eclair]Not what I meant-
                               [Mishelle]Though what happened yesterday didn’t help.
                               [Eclair]What happened yesterday?
                               [Mishelle]With Fiona…?
                               [Eclair]You mean the…accident that we all had yesterday?
                               [Mishelle]See, you DO remember! How weird is it that all three
                               of us flooded and leaked right there after school at
                               the same time.
                               [Eclair]\iVery weird\i.
                               [Mishelle]Yeah, and don’t check your internet feeds if you haven’t
                               already. Fiona may have been talking about it to people
                               online last night.
                               [Eclair]How many people?
                               [Mishelle]Basically everyone. Everyone at school anyways. I think
                               that’s why Vince is a little more rattled than usual.
                               [Eclair]That and the fact that you’re around is making him
                               more embarrassed than he’d otherwise be.
                               [Mishelle]Why would Vince be embarrassed around me? I’m pretty
                               sure he’s wet around me plenty of times.
                               [Eclair]Diapered or not, you two are hopeless.
                               [Mishelle]Why? I don’t get it.
                               [Eclair]Never mind. Let’s just get to school. Let’s get this
                               weird day over with.

2)  EV: 10 / Pg: 1             [Marie]I’ll just wait out here.
                               [Eclair]Okay...



39)  EV: 1 / Pg: 1             [Marna]Good morning! Rise and shine, sleepyhead!
                               [Eclair]*Yawn* What a weird dream.
                               [Marna]What kind of dream, sweety?
                               [Eclair]*Yawn* I’m already having trouble remembering. Is
                               that normal?
                               [Marna]Of course dear. Now rise and shine.
                               [Eclair]*Looks down at her bed* Hey! My bed is dry! How
                               about that? I guess the bed wetting thing was just a
                               fluke after all.
                               [Marna]Dry bed? Eclair, dear, what’s the matter with you. You
                               haven’t had a wet bed since before Kindergarten.
                               [Eclair]Finally, someone is making some sense!
                               [Eclair]*Looks down at her diaper* Why am I wearing this?
                               Did…did you?!
                               [Marna]Did I what?
                               [Eclair]Put this on me?
                               [Marna]That must’ve been some dream. You put it on yourself.
                               [Eclair]I did?
                               [Eclair]*Looks down at her incontinence brief* Oh no. I didn’t, did I?
                               [Marna]Of course you did. You’ve been almost completely
                               urinary incontinent your entire life. It just took us
                               that long for Karlton to diagnose you.
                               Before, we just thought you were just slow at
                               potty-training.
                               [Eclair](No! Not more of this craziness!)
                               *Looks around her room* Wait…why is my room different?
                               [Marna]What do you mean, dear?
                               [Eclair]*Huff* Never mind. Mommy…I mean Mom;  How do I
                               get out of this…thing?
                               [Marna]You go to the bathroom, rip off the tapes, and then hop
                               in the shower, of course. Now get going.
                               [Eclair]Oh yeah…duh.
                               [Marna]You’ve been able to change yourself for years, dear.
                               Just because you’ve got a condition, doesn’t mean
                               you’re a baby. Now quit dawdling.
                               Honestly, I don’t know how you’re going to manage
                               this when you go away to college.



39)  EV: 3 / Pg: 1             [L.R.]Okay, set that thing up, just right.
                               [C.S.]I know what I’m doing.
                               [L.R.]I know you know. I’m just helping.
                               [C.S.]By doing what?
                               [L.R.]Supervising.
                               [C.S.]You are NOT my supervisor.
                               [L.R.]Fine, I’m also keeping lookout to make sure that little miss
                               meddler doesn’t wake up inside her own dream again.
                               []*Eclair stirs*
                               [Eclair]*Groan* Not again.
                               [Eclair]*Groan* Not again.
                               [C.S.]Speaking of which…
                               [L.R.]Crap! Uh…this is a nightmare!  A nightmare! It puts the
                               lotion on its skin, and puts it in the basket.


76)  EV: 16 / Pg: 1            []Just a toy.

76)  EV: 26 / Pg: 2            [Eclair]Huh? I thought that was the last parent? Why are there
                               still babies here? What’s that over there?

76)  EV: 15 / Pg: 1            [Eclair]What’s this? It looks like a pacifier, but it’s too big for a
                               baby to use.
                               [Valerie]Okie babies, all our visitors are gone, it’s time to get
                               you fed and in bed!
                               [Eclair]Oh no, gotta hide!
                               [Valerie]Oh, I know. I know my little ones. You miss your friends
                               that come and visit, and your Mommies and Daddies.
                               But Miss V’s here for you. Miss V loves you.
                               [Eclair](Is this an orphanage, too?)
                               []There’s a rumble in Eclair’s gut. Cramps flare up.
                               [Eclair]*whimpers* Oh no. I gotta go. And not just pee this time.
                               But if I leave now, I’ll miss something. But if I stay I’ll…
                               I’ll poop myself.

                               [Eclair](Can’t miss this. Can’t miss this at all. No matter what.)
                               []\iAs the cramps rattle her body, Eclair bites her lip and
                               holds her breath, doing anything to prevent herself
                               from making a sound.\i
                               []\iBefore long, the pain becomes unbearable, and Eclair’s
                               body begins to act of its own accord. Warm, sticky,
                               disgusting mush begins to push its way out of her.\i
                               []\iAll too soon, it hits the back seat of her incontinence brief, causing
                               her backside to balloon out slightly before it meets resistance and
                               the vile stuff spreads and smears itself all over her cheeks.\i
                               []\iThrough the whole process Eclair can only think “When will
                               it end?”\i
                               []\iOnce she’s past the point of no return, Eclair begins to
                               consciously push to speed things along. There’s no
                               point in further delaying the inevitable.\i
                               [Eclair](Gross...kinda…just give it a second. Okay. Okay. Not bad.
                               I think I can get used to it. Just don’t think about it so much
                               and breathe through my mouth and I’m fine.)

                               [Valerie]And I’ve got some great news, my little darlings. Soon you’ll
                               have three brand new playmates to play with! Won’t that be
                               nice? It’s been a while, hasn’t it? Yes it has! Yes it has!
                               [Eclair](Three? Three playmates?! And me, Mishelle, and Vince
                               are all back in diapers today. That can’t be a coincidence.)
                               [Valerie]Yes it has! *sniffs the air*
                               [Valerie]Uh oh! Smells like someone made a boom boom in their diaper!
                               [Eclair](Oh no! I’m gonna get caught)
                               [Valerie]*sniffs* Oh, Tommy!  How did I know?!  My biggest little
                               boy made a boom boom. Yes he did! Yes he did!  Well
                               let’s get you changed, shall we?
                               [Eclair](I better get out of here!)
                               [Eclair]*Looks at the pacifier still in her hand* Forgot I still had this.
                               Better keep it. It might come in handy, later.
                               [Eclair]Eclair put the pacifier in her backpack.
                               [Eclair]Oh no, I’m gonna be late for dinner!
                               [Eclair](Not worth my dignity!)
                               [Valerie]Huh? What was that? Huh….whatever.
                               [Eclair]Phew...made it. And I’m about out of wipes too. No way
                               could I have cleaned up a mess like that in my diaper.
                               [Eclair]Who knows how Mom would’ve reacted if I had come
                               home for dinner in poopy pants. Good thing I don’t
                               have to worry.

                               [Eclair]Hmm…wet. Still, these will last me the walk home.
                               [Eclair]Might as well change into a fresh dia…a fresh pair while I’m here.


76)  EV: 10 / Pg: 2            [Nanny]But ... You're soaked! Go back home and change your
                               clothes, it's a nursery here, we already have enough
                               work to do with the babies.

76)  EV: 10 / Pg: 3            [Valerie]Interested in applying for an internship?
                               [Eclair]Thanks, but no.
                               [Valerie]Fair enough.  Come back soon!
                               [Eclair]No problem!

76)  EV: 10 / Pg: 4            [Valerie]\mOh! Eclair! Mishelle! Vincent!  Is that you?
                               [Eclair, Mishelle and Vince]Yes Miss V.
                               [Valerie]*Giggles* Oh, you don’t have to call me that. You’re
                               practically all grown up, now. You can call me Valerie.
                               What brings you three here?
                               [Eclair]Okay, Valerie. We’re doing our Career Day
                               assignment to find out more about the town.
                               [Mishelle]So we can appreciate it more when we go to
                               college on the mainland.
                               [Valerie]Oh my, it’s your Career Day already? It seems like
                               just yesterday that I was doing an internship here and
                               you three were all crawling and toddling around.
                               And now, here you are, back again.
                               [Vince]You were an intern here?  I thought you always
                               ran the nursery.
                               [Valerie]Oh, I’ve been working here a long time, now, but I’m
                               not THAT old.  Though I feel it right now with you three
                               all but grown.
                               [Eclair]Do you mind doing us one last favor, and teaching
                               us a bit about your job?
                               [Valerie]Sure, just a second.
                               [Valerie]Right to sleep. Works every time. Okie dokie,
                               what do you want to know?
                               [Vince]Well, where did you go to learn how to take care
                               of little kids?
                               [Valerie]Right here during my internship.
                               [Mishelle]You mean you didn’t leave Farzon?
                               [Valerie]*Shrugs* Didn’t have to.  I’m one of the few who’s
                               never left the island. I grew up, took an internship, and
                               fell in love with this place. And now, here I am.
                               [Eclair]Who ran the nursery before you?
                               [Valerie]Hmm…that’s odd. I can’t quite seem to remember.
                               I guess I’ve been doing this job for a long time, after all.
                               *Shrugs*
                               [Vince]Weird. Me neither.
                               [Eclair]But if Valerie started working here when she was our
                               age, you’d think one of us would remember who ran
                               the place before her.
                               [Mishelle]To be fair, we were all really little.
                               [Valerie]They must have not done as good a job as me, and
                               that’s why they’re so forgettable.
                               [Eclair]Do you always watch all of the babies by yourself?
                               [Valerie]No, not always. Today’s a bit of an odd day, really.
                               I normally have some part timers and assistants and
                               at least one intern; but they all called out sick today.
                               [Vince]Is there anything that’s noteworthy about the
                               town that we don’t know about or we take for granted?
                               [Valerie]Not that I can think of, really.
                               [Mishelle]What about the diapers?
                               [Valerie]...What about them?
                               [Eclair]Can we please not talk about diapers, right now? It’s
                               been a weird enough day.
                               [Mishelle]No, I mean babies are messy and make a lot of
                               garbage. Just imagine all the diapers that Miss V….
                               I mean Valerie has to change in one day.
                               But it doesn’t smell that bad in here, and we don’t
                               have a garbage dump.
                               [Vince]Oh yeah!  I never thought of it that way.
                               [Valerie]Oh, you don’t know about the I.A.’s?
                               The Integrated Atomizers?
                               [Eclair]What about them?
                               [Valerie]They’re our garbage disposal system. We just
                               atomize and disintegrate anything that’s garbage, and
                               release the basic component atoms back into the air.
                               [Mishelle]You mean we’re breathing in garbage?
                               [Valerie]Is it really garbage if it’s all been turned back into
                               carbon and various gases? Also, the forest works
                               fine as a natural air filter.
                               [Eclair]Hmm…that’s kind of neat.  Well, you’re kind of busy,
                               so we’ll let you be.
                               [Valerie]Thanks. I need to rest while the little ones are napping.

                               [Eclair]Cold, cold, cold!
                               [Marna]Now, none of that. Legs up.
                               [Eclair]Yes, Mom.
                               [Marna]Hold still. *Wipes Eclair’s back side.* Now, get your hips
                               up, so I can slide this wet thing out from under you.
                               [Eclair]Yes, Mom.
                               [Marna]And here’s the new one. You can relax now.
                               [Eclair]Thank you.
                               [Marna]Just one more thing.
                               [Eclair]Mommy! No!
                               [Marna]If you’re going to act like a baby and not take responsibility
                               for changing yourself in a timely manner, you’re going to
                               smell like one too.
                               [Eclair]Yes, Mom.
                               [Marna]*sprinkles baby powder all over Eclair* And now we just
                               tape the diaper on…
                               [Marna]..And you’re through. Just like old times.
                               [Eclair]Yes, Mom.
                               [Marna]Alright, now get dressed and get back out there. Unless
                               you need help getting dressed? I’m sure I can pick out
                               something cute for you to wear.
                               [Eclair]*shakes head quickly* No, Mommy. I’m good!

58)  EV: 8 / Pg: 1             [Eclair]A photo from an outing last summer with Mom, out at
                               the beach. She looks so happy.
                               [Eclair]A photo of me and my fr-…
                               [Eclair]What?
                               [Eclair]This photo! It changed! Yesterday, it was a holiday photo
                               we had taken last summer with Mishelle and Vince. Now,
                               it's me and…my Mom?
                               That’s so strange. Did she replace it during the night?
                               What's happening?

                               Nothing but diapers.
                               [Eclair]Let’s just get this over with.
                               [Eclair]Wow, this feels weird. Almost like a maxi pad on
                               steroids, or something. Not too bad, I suppose.
                               [Eclair]I could do without the sound though. It sounds I’ve got
                               a plastic grocery bag in my pockets every time I move.
                               [Eclair]Yeeeaaaah…that’s gonna get old reeeeeal quick.
                               [L.R.]That’s about the only thing that’s gonna get old as far
                               as she’s concerned. Why are we still here again?
                               [C.S.]Because we’ve got a job to do.
                               [L.R.]Job? What job? She’s in a diaper. Mission accomplished!
                               Now get ready to buy me lunch.
                               [C.S.]The change isn’t complete yet.
                               [L.R.]Heheh….you said “change”.
                               [C.S.]Focus! Do you really want to leave this to chance? Do
                               you want to risk that this girl might actually…grow up?
                               [L.R.]Damn it, you’re right! Let’s do this!
                               [C.S.]Now you’re talking!
                               [L.R.]Alright! Now, what do we do?

                               [L.R.]I hate you so much sometimes.

58)  EV: 3 / Pg: 2             [Eclair]Time to get dressed for the day.
                               [Eclair]*Huff* MOTHER!
                               [Marna]Yes dear?
                               [Eclair]Where are my panties?
                               [Marna]Panties?
                               [Eclair]Yes. My panties. Where are they?
                               [Marna]Eclair, honey…You haven’t worn panties since before
                               Kindergarten when we stopped trying to potty training you.
                               [Eclair]…..I….whaaaaaaat?
                               [Marna]You’re almost entirely urinary incontinent, dear. Karlton
                               diagnosed you years ago.
                               At first we thought you were just slow on potty-training,
                               but then we found that you couldn’t help it.
                               [Eclair]...
                               [Marna]Are you feeling alright, dear?
                               [Eclair]Uh…no…I mean…yeah. Just…just give me a minute,
                               alright?
                               [Marna]Of course dear. Breakfast will be ready for
                               you once you’re dressed
                               [Eclair]This cannot be the kind of maturity that Mom was
                               talking about.
                               [Eclair]Has Mom snapped? Did she like taking care of me
                               so much that she’s babying me, now? Weird.
                               [Eclair]Mom must be trying to punish me or something. How’d
                               she manage to sneak in and snatch everything without
                               waking me up?
                               [Eclair]Let’s just get this over with.

58)  EV: 3 / Pg: 3             [Eclair]*Yawn* What a weird dream. I wonder what it means.
                               [Eclair]*Looks down at her diaper* What?! Why am I wearing
                               this?! Who could have put it on me? Did mom do this
                               while I was sleeping? At least I’m dry.
                               [Eclair]*Looks down at her incontinence brief* Hey! I’m dry!
                               How about that?  I guess the bed wetting thing was
                               just a fluke after all.
                               [Eclair]Wait…why is my room different?
                               [Marna]Good morning! Rise and shine, sleepyhead!
                               [Eclair]EEEEP!

                               [Marna]Oh good. You’re already up. Well, don’t let me get in
                               your way. Go on and get showered.

                               [Eclair]*Huff* WHAT?!
                               [Eclair]Come in.
                               [Eclair]Oh, hey Mishelle.
                               [Mishelle]Hey, we came to visit and see how you were doing? We
                               didn’t notice that you slipped out until it was too late.
                               [Vince]Your Mom said it was okay if we came in to try and talk
                               some sense into…

                               [Mishelle]It’s just me.
                               [Eclair]Mishelle? What are you doing here?
                               [Mishelle]We came to check up on you. After what happened at
                               school, we figured you’d need some friends.
                               [Vince]Yeah, your mom is definitely worried about…
                               [Eclair]Eeeep!

                               I mean your diap…I mean sorry! *To Mishelle* Why didn’t you
                               tell me? I wouldn’t have come in.
                               [Eclair]Ditto, Mishelle! I would have at least gotten under my blankets!
                               [Mishelle]*Shrugs*What’s the big deal? We’re all best friends.
                               Besides, she’s more covered up than when she’s
                               wearing a bathing suit.
                               [Eclair]That’s…actually…
                               [Vince]Well…but…
                               [Eclair]Huh…alright.
                               [Vince]Yeah, good point. Still, sorry I barged in, Eclair.
                               [Eclair]Apology accepted, Vince. So, how’d the rest of your day go?
                               [Vince]Heh…kinda awesome.
                               [Mishelle]I’m not sure if you fully registered it because of all the
                               crazy that was going on, but Fiona got stuck on the toilet...
                               [Vince]For hours. Carmella spiked her coffee with a nasty laxative
                               and Maxwell put industrial fast acting superglue on the toilet
                               seat.
                               [Vince]Officer Ronald made Maxwell and Carmella try to pull
                               her off, but she kept crying about how her delicate skin
                               was going to get ripped off.
                               [Mishelle]They eventually had to call Karlton’s lab to transport
                               some super solvent or whatever.
                               [Eclair]Ha!
                               [Vince]But that’s not the best part.
                               [Eclair]What was the best part?
                               [Mishelle]Fiona didn’t  \iquite\i make it to the bathroom in time.
                               [Eclair]You mean…?
                               [Mishelle]She might’ve let a little…slip out before she managed
                               to sit down.
                               [Vince]She had a potty accident. Ruined her panties.
                               [Eclair]Oh my gosh!
                               [Mishelle]Wait, it gets better! Miss Georgette wouldn’t let her put
                               the dirty underwear back on….
                               [Vince]And of course she wasn’t going to be allowed to walk
                               around in a skirt and no underwear…
                               [Mishelle]And they tried calling her dad to come pick her up or
                               bring her some new clothes, but he wouldn’t answer.
                               [Vince]And of course the high school doesn’t have spare underwear
                               on hand. That’s just not something they think about dealing with.
                               [Mishelle]So guess who had the only “underwear” that could
                               possibly fit her?
                               [Eclair]*Gasp* You don’t mean…?!
                               [Vince]That’s right. Miss Georgette made Fiona wear...
                               [Eclair]A diaper?!
                               [Mishelle and Vince]Yeah!
                               [Mishelle]All day long!
                               [Vince]All day long!
                               [Mishelle]Everyone kept calling her a baby, and asking if she needed
                               her diaper changed.
                               [Vince]It was the textbook definition of irony. I’ve never seen
                               her so pissed off.
                               [Mishelle]I mean, I had to give up a diaper, but it was well worth
                               it so that Fiona could see how she treats us.
                               [Vince]Carmella got detention well into next year and Maxwell
                               is going to have to replace that toilet seat, but they both
                               agree it’s totally worth it.
                               [Eclair]And I missed it.*sigh* figures.
                               [Mishelle]So what did you get up to today?
                               [Eclair]Oh yeah! Guys…there’s something important I need to tell you.
                               [Vince]What?
                               [Eclair]Come closer.
                               [Eclair]Guys, I think something weird is going down on the island.
                               [Vince]Like what?
                               [Eclair]I think there’s a conspiracy going on the island.
                               [Mishelle]What kind of conspiracy?
                               [Eclair]I’m not sure, but…I think it has something to do…
                               [Eclair]…with the old abandoned mine…
                               [Eclair]…with why Granny Vincenzia never got married and had kids…
                               [Eclair]…and a bunch of babies at the Daycare that never leave...
                               [Eclair]… and something called “the harvest”…
                               [Eclair]AND WE’RE NEXT!
                               [Vince]...
                               [Mishelle]...
                               [Vince]Heh heh…
                               [Mishelle]Hee-hee...
                               [Vince]Hahahaha!
                               [Mishelle]Ha ha! Hehehe..
                               [Mishelle]Good one, Eclair!
                               [Vince]You had us going for a second.
                               [Eclair]No, I’m serious!
                               [Vince]Seriously?
                               [Eclair]Look, I’ll prove it. Just turn around, okay?
                               [Mishelle]Okay.
                               [Vince]*Shrugs* Sure.
                               []*Eclair removes the package of baby diapers and opens them.*
                               [Eclair]Aha! I knew it!
                               [Mishelle]Can we turn around yet?
                               [Eclair]Not yet. Gimme a second.
                               [Eclair]BEHOLD!
                               [Vince]Wow…Eclair…that’s really neat…I guess…
                               [Mishelle]Yeah…really neat.
                               [Vince]What are we looking at?
                               [Eclair]…Seriously? You don’t see it?
                               []Mishelle and Vince shake their heads.
                               [Eclair]I saw these diapers at the general store, and they were
                               labeled as baby diapers! But look they fit me!
                               [Mishelle]I mean, yeah…kinda.
                               [Vince]It’s a bit of a stretch, but yeah, it fits. Is this a way to tell
                               us that you’re losing weight? Because you’re not fat.
                               [Eclair]Huh? No! I mean this diaper fits me just as well as the other one.
                               [Vince]No it doesn’t.
                               [Mishelle]Not even close.
                               [Eclair]Look at them! This one’s the adult diaper. This one’s the baby one.
                               [Mishelle]Yeah we can tell.
                               [Vince]Kind of obvious.
                               [Eclair]Well yeah it’s obvious. This one has little baby decorations
                               on it, and this one doesn’t. But that’s the only real difference.
                               [Mishelle]And the one for kids is much smaller.
                               [Vince]Much smaller.
                               [Eclair]No it’s not! They’re virtually identical!
                               [Mishelle]I’m pretty sure I could use that one as a stuffer for that one.
                               [Eclair]You really don’t think they’re the same size?
                               []Mishelle and Vince both shake their heads.
                               [Eclair](Oh no! Whatever is affecting people’s memories is
                               also affecting what they see, too.)
                               [Vince]What else you got?
                               [Eclair]Check this out!
                               [Vince]That’s a book, alright.
                               [Mishelle]Oh my! That’s impressive!
                               [Eclair]Based on everything we’ve been through in the last two
                               days, I am almost positive that there’s something in this
                               island’s history, specifically tied to Dr. Harkness Milner
                               that can explain why things have been so strange!
                               [Mishelle]And what have you found?
                               [Eclair]...What?
                               [Vince]What have you read so far?
                               [Eclair]I haven’t…I haven’t exactly had time to read it yet.
                               [Vince]So you have no idea if your hunch has anything to back it up?
                               [Eclair]No.
                               [Mishelle]Aw, I’m sorry Eclair. Oooh, I know! I could read it for you! I
                               take really good notes. It’d only take me a few days to do it.
                               [Eclair]Ooooka…No. No thank, Mishelle. I think I need to this myself.
                               [Vince]Do you have any other proof that things are so different
                               than we remember them?
                               [Eclair]...nothing.
                               [Mishelle]Oh…well then.
                               [Vince]Are you sure you’re okay? You’ve been acting kinda…
                               How do I put this…?

                               Can I walk you home?

                               [Vince]That’s not what I mean, at all.
                               [Mishelle]Is this because you’re avoiding going home and talking
                               to your dad?

3)  EV: 33 / Pg: 9             [Ronald]Hey, gang.  Skipping school, or Career Day?
                               [Eclair]Career Day.
                               [Ronald]I suspected as much. You three never were ones
                               to misbehave, even when you were little. Can’t say
                               the same for Fiona, though.
                               So…you’ve got questions. I’ve got answers. Go on
                               and ask them.
                               [Eclair]So you’re a cop, right?
                               [Ronald]I am a police officer, yeah.
                               [Eclair]How come there’s no jail, or police station?
                               [Ronald]*Shrugs* Not enough crime. I mostly just make
                               sure things are safe for the little tykes.
                               Enforce curfew, make sure things are up to code and
                               that people don’t litter and whatnot.
                               Hold that thought.. ‘Scuse me.
                               Now I know they have their teacher’s permission
                               to be out here, but you, young man, are clearly too
                               young for Career Day.
                               You’re skipping school. *Huff* Kids. You’ve gotta
                               keep them under control or everything goes crazy.
                               *To Eclair* Any other questions?
                               [Eclair]Why is there so little crime?
                               [Ronald]I guess it’s because we have good people here,
                               mainly.  That and with no jail, the most severe
                               punishment is getting kicked off the island.
                               Most people don’t ever want to leave this place.
                               [Mishelle]Yeah, but everybody leaves the island at some
                               point. Or is there a Police Academy here that we
                               don’t know about?
                               [Ronald]True. But everybody who leaves to go see the
                               outside world always comes back when they realize
                               how good they’ve got it here. Anything else?
                               [Vince]Nope.
                               [Ronald]Well then, if you’ll excuse me, this little stinker
                               needs to get back to Kindergarten.
                               [L.R.]Now?
                               [C.S.]Still too early.
                               [L.R.]Oh come on! A cop! And a little kid!
                               Bam! Double whammy!
                               [C.S.]Not yet. Give it time.
                               [L.R.]I’ll give you time. Harumph.


3)  EV: 55 / Pg: 2             [Eclair]Alright. Well now that I’ve got that business taken care
                               of, what to do next. It’s still a little early to go home, yet.
                               But there’s no chance I’m going back to school.
                               [Eclair]Maybe I could go hang with Granny Vincenzia for a little
                               bit. She’s always got some cookies to eat at least.
                               [Eclair]He!We all ate the cookies the same day we wet our pants!
                               [Eclair]What if Granny had something to do with it? Maybe that’s
                               why she encouraged us to go bother Ranger Michael.
                               [Eclair]She knew we were going to wet our pants and wanted us out
                               of her house before we made the connection! But Ranger
                               Michael was acting kind of fishy too, come to think of it.
                               [Eclair]He really didn’t want us to go into that old mine.  And there
                               were those strange carvings on the wall. Why didn’t he
                               want us to see that?
                               [Eclair]Maybe I should investigate one of them? I probably only
                               have time for one of them.
                               [C.S.]Looks like someone is playing detective.

                               [Ranger Michael]Is that so?
                               Didn’t I warn you kids to stay away from this place?

                               [Carmella]*Smirk* So? It takes a lot more effort to come out
                               here than it does to just go home.
                               [Ranger Michael]Is that so?
                               Didn’t I warn you kids to stay away from this place?

60)  EV: 14 / Pg: 2            [Eclair]Hey guys! Over here! I think I found something!
                               [Eclair]Look at this back wall. It’s not made of rock like the
                               rest of this place. It’s made of metal. And look,
                               something is carved into it. It’s…it’s a mural.
                               []\iThe Mural is drawn crudely with stick figures and
                               is made up of three sections. The first section depicts
                               a small stick figure on all fours, crawling.\i
                               \iThen as your eye travels to the right, the stick figures
                               are standing and becoming successively bigger. Up
                               in the right hand corner of the first panel is a circle\i
                               \iwith lines coming out of it. A sun perhaps.
                               Inside the circle is another stick figure.\i
                               \iThe Middle Section shows two stick figures. One is
                               significantly taller than the other. The tall one’s arms
                               and legs are too long and are disproportionate\i

                               is directly overhead. There is no man inside
                               it now.\i
                               \iThe Final Section depicts the sun, once again with

                               [Ranger Michael]Is that so?
                               Didn’t I warn you kids to stay away from this place?

                               [Eclair]Well...Nothing here, I should investigate Ranger Michael's house.

60)  EV: 10 / Pg: 2            [Eclair]Hey guys! Over here! I think I found something!
                               [Eclair]Look at this back wall. It’s not made of rock like the
                               rest of this place. It’s made of metal. And look,
                               something is carved into it. It’s…it’s a mural.
                               []\iThe Mural is drawn crudely with stick figures and
                               is made up of three sections. The first section depicts
                               a small stick figure on all fours, crawling.\i
                               \iThen as your eye travels to the right, the stick figures
                               are standing and becoming successively bigger. Up
                               in the right hand corner of the first panel is a circle\i
                               \iwith lines coming out of it. A sun perhaps.
                               Inside the circle is another stick figure.\i
                               \iThe Middle Section shows two stick figures. One is
                               significantly taller than the other. The tall one’s arms
                               and legs are too long and are disproportionate\i
                               \icompared to the shorter stick figure.The sun
                               is directly overhead. There is no man inside
                               it now.\i
                               \iThe Final Section depicts the sun, once again with
                               this longer, lankier stick man inside it.\i
                               \iThe other stick man is crawling again, surrounded
                               by smaller crawling stick figures on either side.\i
                               [Eclair]What do you think?
                               [Vince]I think it’s graffiti.

                               [Peter Sayers]Awww, heck. Do you really think that’s how libraries work?
                               [Eclair]*Looks up* You…mean…they…don’t?
                               [Peter Sayers]Of course not. It’s just a library fine. It doesn’t mean
                               you’re a bad person.
                               [Eclair]It…doesn’t?
                               [Peter Sayers]Not at all. Here. Just take them.
                               [Eclair]Really? You mean it?
                               [Peter Sayers]Sure thing. You did a good thing, and were honest, and
                               honestly deserves to be rewarded.
                               [Eclair]Yay! Thank you!

                               [Missy Sayers]I think you just got played.
                               [Peter Sayers]I always was a sucker for a sob story.
                               [Peter Sayers]Well fancy seeing you here, again, Eclair. What can I
                               do for you?
                               [Eclair]I’ve got money now, and my undies could use an upgrade.

                               off of. Oh, and some stickers if you have them!
                               [Peter Sayers]Eclair, I can tell you’re excited about something, but
                               you’re going to have to speak more plainly for me.
                               I’m just not following.

                               [Peter Sayers]Eclair, people are in and out of here all day every day. I
                               can’t keep track of it all. You’ll have to refresh my memory.

                               [Peter Sayers]Oh! Well then why didn’t you say so? Here you are.

                               [Eclair]Errrr…I want these really, really, bad. But I need to think about it.
                               [Eclair]Actually, do you mind holding off on that? I need some
                               more time to budget.
                               [Peter Sayers]I can hold them the rest of the day.
                               [Missy Sayers]But not a moment longer. The second the store closes,
                               these go off the counter and back on the shelf.

                               [Missy Sayers]A better way to phrase the question, Eclair.  Well,
                               we have a lot of help from our IA.
                               [Peter Sayers]Our Integrated Atomizer!
                               [Vince]The thing that I use to adjust my heat?
                               [Peter Sayers]Most every building has an IA, and yes, it does link
                               in with a home’s internal systems, but it does so
                               much more.
                               [Missy Sayers]It’s a virtually bottomless supply cache.  Folks at the
                               docks scan the things that get shipped in…
                               [Peter Sayers]Their IA then breaks it down to the atomic level and
                               transports it to our IA…
                               [Missy Sayers]And then it winds up on our shelves, fully
                               materialized.  No delivery truck needed!
                               [Eclair]Seriously?
                               [Peter Sayers]Quite serious.
                               [Eclair]Holy cow!  I just realized, I’ve never seen a delivery
                               truck, except for movies and T.V.
                               [Missy Sayers]Ahhh youth.  They take everything for granted,
                               don’t they dear?
                               [Peter Sayers]Not observant at all.  Probably wouldn’t notice
                               something if it bit them right on the nose.
                               [Mishelle]Then why have a store at all?  Why not just
                               atomize and transport everything directly to people’s
                               homes?
                               [Missy Sayers]That has more to do with the community’s
                               philosophy, than with our technological capabilities.
                               [Peter Sayers]That, and we have a contract with the dock workers
                               so that they don’t beam our merchandise to other
                               people’s places.
                               [Vince]What philosophy?  I haven’t heard of any philosophy.
                               [Peter Sayers]Well that would be best explained by Mayor Knox.
                               Now get going, you three.  We’re not going to sit
                               around answering all of your questions.
                               Go seek more knowledge elsewhere.
                               [Missy Sayers]Oh, Eclair, if you have a minute.
                               *Whispers* Your mother called me earlier today.
                               Thought I might have something to help you with
                               your little bed wetting problem.
                               [Eclair]Et tu, Mrs. Sayer?
                               [Missy Sayers]Would you be a dear and take this package of
                               incontinence briefs home with you to your mother?
                               [Eclair]What’s that, Mrs. Sayer? I…I didn’t get that.
                               I think I hear my mother calling. Gotta go!
                               She wants to ruin my life.  That must be it.
                               [L.R.]Oh come on! Why couldn’t I have pushed the button,
                               then?!  That would have been perfect, right there with
                               the diapers, and everything!
                               Gray haired girl wouldn’t have known what hit her!
                               [C.S.]The timing wasn’t right. According to the manual,
                               in order to manually initiate a sync up, she has to be
                               in a state of great emotional distress when she goes
                               to sleep.  It’s too early, yet. I don’t think this would
                               have done the trick.
                               [L.R.]We have a manual?

5)  EV: 34 / Pg: 1             [Missy Sayers]Well hello, Eclair. How are you?
                               [Eclair]I’ve been better.
                               [Missy Sayers]Oh? Now why’s that?
                               [Peter Sayers]Isn’t it obvious? She’s out of incontinence supplies
                               and doesn’t want to go home.
                               [Missy Sayers]Peter! At least be polite enough to let \iher\i tell us that!
                               [Eclair]How…? How did you know?
                               [Peter Sayers]Why else would you be here in the middle of a school
                               day and blushing three shades of red? You kids get

                               [L.R.]What’s weird about it? She peed the bed. They all do
                               at first. Standard procedure.
                               [C.S.]Yeah…but she’s blushing.\p[10] Doesn’t that seem weird
                               to you?
                               [L.R.]Considering what our jobs are, not really.\p[10]But hey if
                               “girl blushing after wetting the bed” is your thing, who
                               am I to judge?
                               [C.S.]No, you jackass! I mean \iwhy\i is she embarrassed?
                               [C.S.]Everyone affected by the technology is supposed to
                               have next to no realization that anything is different.
                               [C.S.]Why would she be embarrassed about wetting the
                               bed when she’s supposed to think she’s been doing
                               it her whole life?
                               [L.R.]There’s plenty of things that I’ve been doing my whole
                               life that I’m embarrassed about. Maybe she’s just uh…
                               an embarrassed bed wetter?
                               [Eclair]Why did I wet the bed? Why is Mom acting so casual
                               about it?

                               is up!
                               [L.R.]So?
                               [C.S.]So?! !\p[10] So?! Nothing like this has happened
                               before! We’ve got to fix this so that things don’t get
                               out of hand.
                               [C.S.]We’ve never had three tributes at the same time, and
                               none of them has ever been aware that their world
                               was changing.
                               [L.R.]I mean…there was that one that had the daughter. The
                               daughter might’ve realized something was-
                               [C.S.]We almost got fired that last time!!\p[10] Do you want to
                               get fired?
                               [L.R.]…I do not. Want me to call management?
                               [C.S.]Want me to tell management that you were beating
                               on the panel like you were a prizefighter?
                               [L.R.]…\p[10]Nope…\p[10]don’t like that either. So what do you suggest,
                               oh wise one?
                               [C.S.]Let’s just sit back and watch. We normally do this in
                               increments, anyways, for just this reason.
                               We’ll make sure she’s distracted enough, and fine tune
                               the Sync System later tonight.
                               [L.R.]So…just wait and see? Like no more talking to each other?
                               [C.S.]God,\p[10] I hope so.

                               caves when I don't like small spaces. That may have
                               been a mistake...

                               most of it working in a cave.

                               [Mona]I need a little…urgh…help here.

                               a bit of a handful right now.
                               [Mona]Well, I need…a break…if you know what I mean.
                               [Valerie]I’ll be right there to relieve you, hon!
                               [Mona]Please don’t say relieve!
                               [Valerie]Just a second.
                               [Mona]Ugggh. No. Come on. Come on. I can’t….I can’t…I can’t…
                               [Valerie]You can’t what?
                               [Mona]Hold it!....oh no!
                               [Valerie]Okay, I’m here. What’s up?
                               [Mona]I….I….I…
                               [Valerie]Mona? What’s wrong honey?
                               [Mona]I…I had…an accident.
                               [Valerie]So? That’s why you wear your incontinence briefs, Mona.
                               Everybody knows about your urinary incontinence. I knew
                               it when I agreed to take you in as my intern.
                               [Valerie]*sniff* But I think one of the little ones had a different
                               kind of accident.
                               [Valerie]Now which one of you little stinkers was it?
                               [Mona]Miss Gans.
                               [Valerie]Was it you?
                               [Mona]Miss Gans...
                               [Valerie]Or you?
                               [Mona]Miss Gans...
                               [Valerie]What about…?
                               [Mona]It was me.
                               [Valerie]You? But Mona, you told me you were only urinary incontinent.
                               [Mona]I am, ma’am. I just…I just had an accident.
                               [Valerie]How did that happen?
                               [Mona]I just needed to go, but I couldn’t leave the little ones alone…
                               And by the time you came, it was too late.
                               [Valerie]Oh, you poor thing. Tell you what. Go use one of the tubs
                               and get yourself cleaned up. Then when you’re done, you
                               can take the rest of the day off and go home.
                               [Mona]Are…are you sure?
                               [Valerie]Sure as sure can be. Now get to it. I don’t want my favorite
                               intern to get a rash.
                               [Mona]…Yes ma’am…
                               [Valerie]Oh, and Mona?
                               [Mona]Yes, Miss Gans?
                               [Valerie]You don’t have any kids, do you?
                               [Mona]No! Of course not!  I’m barely out of high school. I don’t
                               even have a boyfriend right now. Why do you ask?
                               [Valerie]Oh, no reason. Just checking.
                               [Mona]Checking what?
                               [Valerie]I meant, “Just wondering”. Idle curiosity is all.

                               [Scout]It must date from the time the mining company was active

                               [Maxwell]So, not to be awkward, but I’ve seen some of the things
                               that Fiona is posting about you guys online.
                               [Vince]Yeah, about that…can we not talk about it?
                               [Maxwell]That was really uncool of her.
                               [Mishelle]*Shrugs* Yeah, but that’s Fiona, so what can you do?
                               [Maxwell]Actually, me and Carmella were thinking about that.
                               [Eclair]Yeah?
                               [Maxwell]Yeah. So, weird piece of advice: If you guys need to
                               umm…freshen up; you should probably do it before
                               Fiona’s report about what she found on Career Day.
                               If Carmella timed it right and everything goes according
                               to plan, let’s just say Fiona will likely be in the bathroom
                               for a looooong time.
                               [Eclair]Timed what right?
                               [Maxwell]Don’t worry about it. Nobody picks on my sister’s buddies
                               and gets away with it. The rest of the school’s got your back,
                               even if the Miss Georgette can’t technically do anything about it.
                               [Eclair]Your sister’s buddies? What do you-?
                               [Mishelle]Come on Eclair. Let’s get to class.

                               [Maxwell]So I don’t know how you guys…clean up or whatever.
                               But if it involves sitting on the toilet, like for balance or
                               something…I wouldn’t.
                               [Maxwell]Hi Fiona! Did you enjoy your morning coffee from
                               the café?
                               [Fiona]Outta my way, you immature milk drinker! I’ve got a
                               presentation.
                               [Maxwell]Huh…milk drinker. That’s a new one. Right this way,
                               Miss Mature!
                               [Maxwell]Everything go alright?
                               [Carmella]Yup. Right in her coffee, and she didn’t even notice.
                               The gang here?
                               [Maxwell]Just got here.
                               [Carmella]Alright! If Fiona wants to make such a big deal out of
                               my friends wearing diapers, let’s see how she likes
                               being stuck on a toilet for a couple hours!
                               [Maxwell]Hey, is something up with Eclair, today?
                               [Carmella]She’s being a little weird lately, why?
                               [Maxwell]Nothing really. She’s just looked a little confused,
                               maybe, even a little hurt that I referred to her as your
                               friend instead of mine?
                               [Carmella]Aww, she’s just in a vulnerable place right now, thanks
                               to Fiona.
                               [Maxwell]But it’s not like I hang out with you guys all that often.
                               I mean should I?
                               [Carmella]Naw…who’s wanna hang out with you anyways.
                               *sticks out her tongue*

                               [L.R.]You put that idea in their head?
                               [C.S.]Of course.
                               [L.R.]How’d you know they’d go through with it.
                               [C.S.]Their farmers, and I actually have a real country family,
                               so I knew how they’d react.
                               [L.R.]Yeah, but how is this gonna destabilize the girl enough

                               [Eclair]Hey, Maxwell.
                               [Maxwell]So, not to be awkward, but I’ve seen some of the things
                               that Fiona is posting about you guys online.
                               [Vince]Yeah, about that…can we not talk about it?
                               [Maxwell]That was really uncool of her.
                               [Mishelle]*Shrugs* Yeah, but that’s Fiona, so what can you do?
                               [Maxwell]Actually, me and Carmella were thinking about that.
                               [Eclair]Yeah?
                               [Maxwell]Yeah. So, weird piece of advice: If you guys need to
                               umm…freshen up; you should probably do it before
                               Fiona’s report about what she found on Career Day.
                               If Carmella timed it right and everything goes according
                               to plan, let’s just say Fiona will likely be in the bathroom
                               for a looooong time.
                               [Eclair]Timed what right?
                               [Maxwell]Don’t worry about it. Nobody picks on my sister’s buddies
                               and gets away with it. The rest of the school’s got your back,
                               even if the Miss Georgette can’t technically do anything about it.
                               [Eclair]Your sister’s buddies? What do you-?
                               [Mishelle]Come on Eclair. Let’s get to class.
                               [Maxwell]Oh, wait, one more thing!
                               [Vince]What?
                               [Maxwell]So I don’t know how you guys…clean up or whatever.
                               But if it involves sitting on the toilet, like for balance or
                               something…I wouldn’t.
                               [Maxwell]Hi Fiona! Did you enjoy your morning coffee from
                               the café?
                               [Fiona]Outta my way, you immature milk drinker! I’ve got a
                               presentation.
                               [Maxwell]Huh…milk drinker. That’s a new one. Right this way,
                               Miss Mature!
                               [Maxwell]Everything go alright?
                               [Carmella]Yup. Right in her coffee, and she didn’t even notice.
                               The gang here?
                               [Maxwell]Just got here.
                               [Carmella]Alright! If Fiona wants to make such a big deal out of
                               my friends wearing diapers, let’s see how she likes
                               being stuck on a toilet for a couple hours!
                               [Maxwell]Hey, is something up with Eclair, today?
                               [Carmella]She’s being a little weird lately, why?
                               [Maxwell]Nothing really. She’s just looked a little confused,
                               maybe, even a little hurt that I referred to her as your
                               friend instead of mine?
                               [Carmella]Aww, she’s just in a vulnerable place right now, thanks
                               to Fiona.
                               [Maxwell]But it’s not like I hang out with you guys all that often.
                               I mean should I?
                               [Carmella]Naw…who’s wanna hang out with you anyways.
                               *sticks out her tongue*
                               [C.S.]And the first domino has been knocked down.
                               [L.R.]What the heck does that mean?
                               [C.S.]Just wait for it. I’ve got the smoothest of moves going down.
                               [L.R.]I didn’t see you push any buttons!
                               [C.S.]There are more ways to regress someone than by
                               pushing a button.
                               [L.R.]Name one!
                               [C.S.]Like sending an email so a couple of sisters got an
                               idea for revenge.
                               [L.R.]You put that idea in their head?
                               [C.S.]Of course.
                               [L.R.]How’d you know they’d go through with it.
                               [C.S.]Their farmers, and I actually have a real country family,
                               so I knew how they’d react.
                               [L.R.]Yeah, but how is this gonna destabilize the girl enough
                               so that she regresses more?
                               [C.S.]Watch and learn my friend. Watch and learn.

                               [Eclair]What’s that?
                               [Miss Georgette]Keep an eye on Fiona for me. She always gets
                               particularly…difficult… around this time of year, it seems.
                               I think she could really use a friend right about now.
                               [Eclair]You have no idea what you’re asking me to do.
                               [Miss Georgette]Fiona’s had it hard. She never really knew her
                               mother, and I think it’s affected her deeply.
                               I’ve tried to do what I can with her, but I think she’d respond
                               more with a peer.
                               [Eclair]Fiona’s the very definition of a bully and an
                               antisocial snob. If there’s a way to help her, I’m not
                               the one to do it.
                               [Miss Georgette]*sighs* Fine. Could you do me one other favor?
                               [Eclair]What favor?
                               [Miss Georgette]Would you consider going to an arts college next year?
                               It’d be nice to have some real culture around here;
                               maybe some musical theatre or something.
                               [Eclair]Ha! That’s a definite maybe, Miss Georgette.

                               [Eclair]Get over yourself, Fiona. You did Career day by
                               yourself because you don’t have any friends.
                               [Fiona]Pffft. Sticks and stones, kids. Sticks and stones.

                               [Vince]So we’re not insulting you when we say that nobody
                               likes you.

                               Now we have only seven days left before the
                               summer break, and I thought to myself “What

                               [Mishelle]Oh…you’re welcome.
                               [Miss Georgette]As you young people know, next year will be your
                               final year of schooling.
                               [Fiona]Thank God!
                               [Miss Georgette]I’m choosing to ignore that, Fiona. Moving on.
                               But as you all know, we do not have any Colleges or
                               higher education facilities here on Farzon, despite
                               having many college educated adults here on the
                               island. Does anyone know why that is?
                               [Vince]Because they want us to leave.
                               [Miss Georgette]Well, Vincent, you are correct in that, though I
                               wouldn’t be so cut and dry about it. We do encourage
                               our young people to go out into the world, though.

                               [Miss Georgette]Mishelle?
                               [Mishelle]The original owner of the island of Farzon was
                               Doctor Harkness Milner. He’s also the man who
                               paid for the observatory at Hane Shore!
                               [Miss Georgette]Correct on all counts! Most of this island’s layout is
                               by his original design, including the lack of education
                               after high school. But that’s a little weird isn’t it?
                               We’ve got our own food supply, our own power
                               supply, law enforcement, mines, and forest. We’ve
                               got a nearly perfect ecosystem for our little
                               community here. And you may not realize it or
                               appreciate it, but despite our looks, our little
                               community is much more advanced than it seems.
                               In some areas of technology, we’re actually
                               decades ahead of the rest of the world.
                               [Fiona]Pffft, yeah right. The computers around
                               here all look older than Granny Vincenza; and she’s
                               older than the internet.
                               [Miss Georgette]Oh really, Fiona? Then tell me, why are they
                               operating over three times as fast as last year’s
                               Pear models out on the mainland?
                               [Fiona]Umm….
                               [Eclair]Ha!
                               [Miss Georgette]And Eclair, have you noticed that there’s no power
                               plants on Farzon, yet everything is still powered?
                               [Eclair]Uh…not till you just said it, no.
                               [Maxwell]Tsk tsk tsk.
                               [Miss Georgette]Maxwell, so nice of you to join the discussion. How
                               does your father manage to grow vegetables for the
                               entire island?
                               [Maxwell]Emm…machines?
                               [Miss Georgette]What \ikind\i of machines?
                               [Maxwell]…Tractors?
                               [Miss Georgette]Maxwell, think for a second, dear. You live on
                               that farm. Have you ever seen a tractor there?
                               [Maxwell]*Sighs* No.
                               [Miss Georgette]Where do most of our goods come from if they’re
                               not manufactured here, Vince?
                               [Vince]My dad works at the docks…so…boats?
                               [Miss Georgette]And where do the boats get their supplies from.
                               What do we offer in trade or payment for our
                               amenities?
                               [Vince]*Shrugs*
                               [Miss Georgette]What about our books for the library?
                               [Vince]…I have no idea.
                               [Miss Georgette]And how is it possible that we all have homes, a
                               general store, a school, an ice cream shop, a
                               kindergarten, a plantation, mines, forests, a café,
                               an observatory, a port, a lighthouse, a library, and a
                               public nursery, and yet we have no power plant, nor
                               garbage disposal service, nor farming equipment,
                               and computers that are older and yet faster than the
                               most top of the line technology out there? How can
                               we have all of these things, while contrarily lack some
                               of the most basic services that these other things
                               depend on? How are we managing to thrive in this
                               little town, on this little island?
                               [Eclair]I…don’t know. I guess we’ve kind of taken it all
                               for granted.
                               [Miss Georgette]Exactly! You’ve all lived here your entire lives, and
                               yet you know next to nothing about the little world we call home.
                               One day, you will all go out into the world so that you may
                               better know it and understand it. But before you do that,
                               you need to know about the world around you right here.
                               You need to learn about your community.
                               [Fiona]I don’t like where this is going.
                               [Miss Georgette]I’m going to let you all take lunch a little early, today.
                               [Fiona]Never mind. This is working out.
                               [Miss Georgette]And then when you’re done, you’re to go around the
                               island and interview different members of the community.
                               Learn what they do, and how they do it.  Learn about
                               the different services they provide around town and
                               how they do it.
                               [Fiona]*Huff* Great…Career Day. Never mind my never mind.
                               [Miss Georgette]Find out why things are the way they are around here.
                               Learn about the history of your home. Then, tomorrow,
                               be ready to present what you’ve learned to your friends.
                               [Eclair]*snicker* I guess that leaves Fiona out.
                               You have to have friends.
                               [Fiona]Watch it, you immature little brat.
                               [Miss Georgette]Ladies, you will respect each other while you’re
                               in my classroom.
                               [Fiona and Eclair]Sorry ma’am.
                               [Miss Georgette]Class dismissed for lunch.

                               [Eclair]Me?! What?! No! I mean not really. Today’s the first day
                               that I’ve needed to…no. Nope. Nope nope nope nope.

                               [Richard]Oh wow, I am so sorry, how rude of me. Allow me to introduce
                               myself. I’m a photographer for a big fashion magazine, and
                               what I really should have asked is…are you a model?
                               [Eclair]Me?! What?! No! I mean…do you think I could be?
                               [Richard]Oh I’d say you’ve got the right stuff.  I’m actually looking
                               for some models on a brand new line of clothing.
                               [Eclair]Really?
                               [Richard]Yes really. This thing is going to hit the mainland like a
                               hammer. It’s something new. Never done before!
                               Revolutionary!  It’s meant to be a clothing line that
                               [Richard]captures both a woman’s confidence and inner strength,
                               while still maintaining her softer, more delicate side. It’s
                               a clothing line that will show little girls that it’s okay to
                               [Richard]grow up and that you don’t have to remake yourself to
                               fit into man’s world!  It’s called…um…Innocence! And
                               I think you could potentially be the face of it!
                               [Eclair]Do you mean it?
                               [Richard]Darn tootin’ I do! So what do you say?
                               [Eclair]Hmmm…I could use the money.
                               [Richard]Money?! Who said anything about money?! I don’t have any extra
                               mon…I mean…you’re a complete unknown.
                               [Richard]Do you have any idea how much it costs to build a proper

                               [Eclair]How much?
                               [Richard]You couldn’t afford it.
                               [Eclair]Oh…
                               [Richard]Hey, hey, hey! Don’t walk off just yet! *sigh* Tell ya what,

                               now, anyways. We just have to stay the course.
                               [L.R]Yeah, but what if it starts regressing us, too? What if
                               we start to act less mature?

                               batch. Now’s my chance! If it’s anything like Fiona, she’ll
                               be there a while.
                               [Eclair]Time to snoop for more evidence. The Mayor knows
                               more than he’s letting on. I can feel it in my gut!

                               week till the Harvest.  Cutting it close this time.
                               No mistakes.”

                               [Eclair]*Slams paper back down in desk.* No,
                               we’re not snooping through your stuff, why
                               would you think that?!

                               [Eclair]Yes. Yes we are.
                               [Mayor Knox]I thought as much.
                               [Eclair]Mind telling us a little bit about your job, and how
                               it relates to us?
                               [Mayor Knox]Why of course! Ahem. As Mayor, it is my solemn
                               duty to see to the prosperity of our little paradise
                               island- keeping people’s trust, making sure that
                               their needs are met, and so on- while trying to stay
                               true to the vision set forth by our founder,
                               Dr. Harkness Milner.
                               [Mishelle]What vision is that?
                               [Mayor Knox]So glad you asked, young lady.
                               Dr. Milner bought this island and settled it with the
                               intention of making it the best place for good people
                               to be the best they possibly can be!
                               [Vince]That means…nothing. I got nothing.
                               [Mayor Knox]He intended to make it a Utopia of sorts.
                               A perfect place where people could live perfect lives,
                               or at least darn close to it.  All our energy is clean,
                               and efficient,and the people are all friendly here.
                               Free schooling and child care, the best health care
                               available, and everyone who wants a job gets a job
                               to contribute back to the community.
                               [Eclair]No offense Mr. Mayor, but don’t most Utopias
                               either collapse under their own weight or become
                               Dystopias?
                               [Mayor Knox]Well, this place isn’t exactly a Utopia.
                               Human nature isn’t exactly perfect, mind you, and so
                               nothing created by humans, or with humans involved
                               can beperfect, either.
                               So perhaps “Utopia” is a bit of an exaggeration, but we
                               strive for the best.  Always advancing, and always looking
                               for new and fresh ideas so we don’t become stagnant.
                               [Vince]That’s why you don’t have a college. Or really
                               anything that trains you beyond high school.
                               [Mayor Knox]Exactly, young man!  We don’t want to shut
                               ourselves away from the world.
                               We want our young people to go into the world,
                               experience the best that it has to offer, and then
                               bring some of it back here.
                               [Eclair]You mean…like a harvest of sorts?
                               [Mayor Knox]You could say that, I suppose. Yes. And so far, it’s
                               worked out very well for us.
                               There are corporations that pay us money NOT to
                               share some of our innovations with the rest of the
                               world. They’re afraid we’d put them out of business.
                               [Mishelle]Wait, but if we’re so advanced, why don’t we seem
                               more advanced?  Everything here always seems
                               so…so…
                               [Vince]Hum drum? Older than the internet?
                               [Mayor Knox]Why…don’t you know? Where do you think the
                               internet was invented, dear students?
                               [Eclair]Seriously? Our history books say it was Al
                               something or another.
                               [Mayor Knox]Hahahaha! I’m sorry, that’s just a little joke I say
                               when I get the chance.
                               You young people, and your slang!  No, our community
                               hasn’t been around THAT long. We’re not older than
                               the internet. No, the reason why things are so, hum,
                               drum as you say, is because that was the other part
                               of Dr. Milner’s philosophy: Humility.
                               [Eclair]Humility?
                               [Mayor Knox]Yes. The best of technology, combined with the best
                               of humility. Monks don’t wear those rags because it
                               makes them Holy, but because they believe it keeps
                               them humble and conscientious of others. And so
                               we too do our best to keep a humble façade. We
                               keep people working as long as they want to, even
                               if they don’t need to work. We make our aesthetics
                               a little less fancy and appealing than they need to
                               be, and we generally do our best to NOT be noticed
                               by the outside world. We don’t want the rest of the
                               world telling us how to live our lives,so we try to be
                               humble so they won’t want to tell us how to live ours.
                               [Vince]That…kind of makes sense.
                               [Mayor Knox]*Winks* Doesn’t it though? Now, if you’ll excuse me,
                               I have duties that I must attend to.
                               [Eclair]Thank you for your time, Mr. Mayor.
                               [Mayor Knox]Thank you, young lady. Now off you go.
                               [L.R.]Why couldn’t I have pushed the button then? It would
                               have been perfect!
                               [C.S.]Not yet.
                               [L.R.]Come on!  Wetting your pants right in front of the
                               Mayor?! How embarrassing would that have been?
                               The windbag would have probably made some
                               kind of proclamation: “All those who wet their pants
                               in front of the mayor are legally tiny tiny children!”
                               Or something like that.
                               [C.S.]We have to wait. There’s an art to this.

                               [Mishelle]Hey guys. Sorry. I woke up late and my mom…
                               Well, y’know.
                               [Vince]Yeah…we know.  Happened to me too. It’s a
                               drag, but what are you gonna do?
                               [Mishelle]I would have been ready sooner, but my mom
                               wanted to have a talk with me.
                               [Eclair]About what?
                               [Mishelle]About me getting…protection. So that maybe my
                               mom won’t have to deal with wet sheets every
                               morning, anymore.
                               [Vince]Yeah…I got a bad feeling my dad and I are gonna
                               have that talk when we get back from school.
                               [Eclair]Okay, guys, what is going on, here?
                               [Mishelle]What do you mean, Eclair?
                               [Eclair]I woke up with a wet bed this morning, too. And my
                               mom is trying to convince me to wear diapers to bed.
                               And all of this is just coming out of nowhere, and I
                               have no idea what’s going on.
                               [Vince]Hmmm….you too?
                               [Mishelle]That \iis\i weird.
                               [Eclair]I know, right?!
                               [Vince]Our parents must be talking to each other.
                               [Mishelle]They wanted to spring this on us all at once
                               so that maybe we’d all start wearing them together.
                               [Eclair]...
                               [Vince]Typical.
                               [Mishelle]Very.
                               [Eclair]...
                               [Mishelle]You don’t suppose that’s why they woke us up late,
                               do you? Make night time protection seem even
                               more convenient?
                               [Vince]I wouldn’t put it past them. Adults, man.
                               [Eclair]What in the heck are you guys
                               talking about?!
                               [Mishelle]Um…our bed wetting problem…?
                               [Vince]Quiet down, Mishelle. I thought we agreed we don’t
                               talk about it unless we’re behind closed doors.
                               You don’t want the rest of the island to know, do you?
                               [Mishelle]I was barely talking above a whisper.
                               [Eclair]Guys!\p[10] We’re!\p[10] Not!\p[10] Bed wetters!\p[10]
                               [Mishelle]Since when?
                               [Vince]I mean…we don’t go broadcasting it or anything.
                               [Eclair]Because there’s nothing to broadcast!
                               [Mishelle and Vince]*Sigh* Denial.
                               [Mishelle]Don’t you remember, Eclair? We all became friends
                               when we realized we all had the same…ahem…
                               problem?
                               That’s why we didn’t go to other kids’ sleepovers
                               back in the day? Hey, Vince, remember what our
                               parents used to call our sleepovers?
                               [Vince]*sigh* Soggy Slumber Parties.
                               [Eclair]Oh my gawd!  That is gross.
                               [Vince]Yeah…that’s why I don’t like thinking about it.
                               [Mishelle]Oh, that reminds me. Eclair, Marie says “sorry” if she
                               offended you. She didn’t mean anything by it.
                               And I didn’t tell her either. I think she just figured it
                               out…a while ago.
                               [Eclair]There’s nothing to figure…! *Deep breath* I don’t
                               know what has made everyone in my life go so crazy,
                               but it is officially older than the internet, now.
                               [Eclair]It is so old, we are now decades away from even
                               binary code, and have gone back to quill and ink.
                               [Mishelle]Oh, that reminds me. Eclair, Marie says “sorry” if she

                               [Mishelle]What are you talking about?
                               [Eclair]Nothing. Just nothing. Let’s just get to
                               school before we’re all late.
                               [Vince]Finally.
                               [L.R.]Holy crud! All three of the affected are friends?
                               How unlikely is that?!
                               [C.S.]This could work to our advantage. Let’s just keep
                               watching till an opportunity presents itself.
                               [L.R.]Roger that.

10)  EV: 2 / Pg: 1             []It's closed.


10)  EV: 2 / Pg: 3             [Mishelle]Eclair, what are you doing? I'm right here.

10)  EV: 2 / Pg: 4             [Marie]Be safe! That'll be our secret*wink*
                               [Eclair]What the...?
                               (Anyways, time is going by, I should look for Vince)

10)  EV: 2 / Pg: 5             [Marie]I am sooooo sorry! I didn’t know it was supposed to be
                               a secret. I mean I haven’t told anybody, but I didn’t know
                               it was a secret.
                               [Eclair]What in the world are you talking about?
                               [Marie]What do you mean what am I…? Ooooooh!  I get it.
                               *wink* I have no idea what I’m talking about either.

10)  EV: 2 / Pg: 6             [Eclair]Hey, Marie.
                               [Marie]Hey Eclair.
                               [Eclair]Mishelle ready for school?
                               [Marie]Nuh-uh. My mom forgot to wake her up, and so she
                               just hopped into the shower.  You know how it is.
                               [Eclair]I…do?
                               [Marie]Oh…am I…am I not supposed to know? I mean…
                               sorry. I am sooooo sorry. No offense. Uh…just... my
                               mom told me to tell you to come back in a little bit.
                               [Eclair]Oooookay….?
                               (Did Mishelle also…? Nah, that’s impossible. And
                               even if she did, how would Mishelle’s kid sister
                               know that I wet the bed this morning, too?)


10)  EV: 8 / Pg: 1             [Vince]*Pant, pant* I…won.
                               [Eclair]*Pant, pant* No…fair…you…cheated. *Pant, pant*

                               [Mishelle]Hey guys. Sorry. I woke up late and my mom…
                               Well, y’know.

                               [Mishelle]What do you mean, Eclair?

                               [Eclair]I know, tell me about it.
                               [Mishelle]Well, there was how weird you were acting earlier today,
                               and then thinking that you did Career Day yesterday, and
                               what happened in the lunchroom with…
                               [Eclair]Mishelle, I was using figure of speech.
                               [Mishelle]Oh sorry. Well, enjoy your day off. Sorry about you wetting
                               your pants in front of everyone.
                               [Eclair]That’s okay. I think these can hold a little more before
                               they leak.
                               [Mishelle]Does that mean you’re going to walk around wet?
                               [Eclair]*Shrug* Maybe. I haven’t thought that far ahead. These
                               are kinda comfy.
                               [Mishelle]But what if you leak again?
                               [Eclair]I’ll just run home and change. I’m pretty sure my Mom
                               will let me in the house for that.

103)  EV: 7 / Pg: 3            [Eclair]*Whispers* So let me get this straight.
                               [Mishelle]*Whispers* Yeah?
                               [Eclair]*Whispers* You’re saying that we were never toilet trained?
                               [Mishelle]*Whispers* I mean it’s not like we don’t know how.
                               It’s just our bladders are really weak. If we’re lucky,
                               we make it in time
                               [Eclair]*Whispers* What about number two?
                               [Mishelle]*Whispers* Why are you asking me what your bathroom
                               habits are?
                               [Eclair]*Whispers* I honestly have no idea. Don’t regular girls
                               go to the bathroom together and stuff? How else are we
                               supposed to bond?
                               [Mishelle]Hahahaha! That's a good one!
                               [Georgette]Something funny, girls? Something you’d care to share
                               with the class?
                               [Mishelle and Eclair]No Ma’am.


103)  EV: 18 / Pg: 1           []These are all junior level books.

103)  EV: 29 / Pg: 1           [Fiona]Hehehehe, returned to the scene of your widdle
                               accident, kiddos? Smells like they didn’t clean
                               the floors well enough to me.
                               [Eclair]Back off, Fiona.
                               [Fiona]Or what? You’re gonna piddle on me? Wait, are you
                               puppies now? Did you mark your territory?
                               [Mishelle]Fiona, stop it, you big bully!
                               [Fiona]Awww, why are you cwying? Is the baby wet? It’s okay, you can’t
                               help it. Just because my internship at the nursery starts later
                               this week, doesn’t mean I’m going to change you, though.
                               [Fiona]Wait, that smell? You’re not peeing your pants NOW
                               are you?
                               [Vince]Yeah, make fun of the kids with the medical condition.
                               Real classy, Fiona.
                               [Fiona]Operative word being kids. I don’t make fun because
                               you’ve got a medical condition. I make fun because
                               you’re so immature and thin skinned.
                               [Fiona]Oh, and because I can wipe myself.
                               [Vince]Hold me back guys…
                               [Fiona]Oh, you’re going to hit me?That’s real mature. Are your
                               fists balled up because you’re planning on swinging or
                               are you just getting ready to take a little walk and…
                               [Fiona]...Stretch your legs?
                               [Mishelle]I told you everyone noticed.
                               [Vince]MISHELLE! NOT NOW!
                               [Eclair]She’s not worth it Vince, let her go.
                               [Fiona]Smart move. See you babies in class. I have a report
                               to give.
                               [Maxwell]What happened?
                               [Eclair]Fiona.
                               [Carmella]Don’t worry guys. The Hanners Sisters got this. Stick
                               around and enjoy the show.
                               [Miss Georgette]Alright class, everyone take your seats. It’s almost time
                               to hear the reports on Career Day.


103)  EV: 35 / Pg: 2           [Eclair]Time to get out of here!

103)  EV: 35 / Pg: 3           [Eclair]Time to get out of here!

103)  EV: 35 / Pg: 4           [Eclair]There’s no way I’m going outside soaked like this.
                               I need to get my erm…supplies from the classroom.


103)  EV: 2 / Pg: 2            [Miss Georgette]Alright class, some of us went out and interviewed the
                               various pillars of our community. Who wants to share
                               what they learned?
                               [Eclair]I’ll go!
                               [Miss Georgette]Eclair, do you need to be excused? Is that what you
                               mean?
                               [Eclair]No, I mean I’ll go first. I’ll present what I learned.
                               []Students snicker.
                               [Miss Georgette]Perhaps next year, Eclair, when you actually go and
                               participate in Career Day.
                               [Eclair]But I’ve got it right…*Looks in her desk* Hey! Where’d
                               the notes for the report go?
                               [Miss Georgette]Though, if you had wanted to do a report, Eclair, I suspect
                               you could have just shaken down Mr. Hanners for all the
                               information. Isn’t that right, Maxwell?
                               [Fiona]Busted!
                               [Miss Georgette]And I believe we have our first volunteer. Fiona, the
                               stage is yours.
                               [Fiona]Yes, Miss Georgette.
                               [Mishelle]*Whispers* Pssst! Sit down. Eclair. Let someone
                               who’s old enough do it!
                               [Eclair]*Whispers* We are old enough!
                               [Vince]*Whispers* Yeah, but we’re not in the right grade!
                               [Mishelle]*Whispers* We got held back in Kindergarten because
                               of the whole toilet thing.
                               [Vince]By the time Karlton found something medically wrong
                               with us and got us excused, we were too far behind to
                               go to first grade the next year, so they had us repeat
                               Kindergarten and move on with Carmella.
                               [Eclair]*Whispers* So we’re in the same grade as Carmella, now?
                               [Vince]*Whispers* Now? What do you mean “now”?
                               [Mishelle]*Whispers* We’ve been in the same grade as Carmella
                               for years. We grew up with her.
                               [Miss Georgette]Eclair, have a seat.
                               [Eclair]Yes ma’am.

                               philosophy that has yielded…

                               comprehending what she’s saying! What am I going
                               to do?)
                               [Mishelle]Pssst!
                               [Eclair]*Whispers* What?
                               [Mishelle]*Whispers* You’re zoning out. Here: in case Miss
                               Georgette thinks you’re not paying attention.
                               [Eclair]*Whispers* What are these?
                               [Mishelle]*Whispers* Notes on what Fiona has said so far.
                               [Eclair](Holy cow! These are almost identical to what she wrote
                               yesterday, but they’re in a different color ink! How did
                               she write so much so fast?)
                               [Eclair]*Whispers* Thanks.

                               Some part of her has to. Even if she can’t actively
                               remember it, some part of her does.)

                               some interesting points that I don’t think Fiona considered.
                               [Miss Georgette]Well, we’ll have a question and answer session once
                               everyone who has a presentation has gotten the chance
                               to speak. Until then-
                               [Fiona]No, it’s fine, Miss Georgette. I don’t mind answering
                               questions. Please, widdle Mishelle. What questions
                               do you have?
                               [Fiona]I’ll be happy to answer them in very simple words so
                               that everyone can understand.
                               [Mishelle]Um…are you sure?
                               [Fiona]Oh, I’m \ivery\i sure.
                               [Eclair]*Whispers* Pssst! Go for it!
                               [Mishelle]Okaaaay. But you asked for it.
                               [Fiona]Bring it.
                               [Mishelle]What’s Mayor Knox’s political party?
                               [Fiona]Um…Independent?
                               [Mishelle]Are there any other political parties on Farzon?
                               [Fiona]No…?
                               [Mishelle]Does that mean there’s only one way to implement
                               or interpret Dr. Harkness Milner’s philosophy?
                               [Fiona]I guess so?
                               [Mishelle]Also what about Mr. Hanners’s nano-bots in the soil
                               that you mentioned?
                               [Fiona]What about them?
                               [Mishelle]He told you that we hide their existence from the mainland
                               to protect our secrets, so no one can steal them and use
                               them without our permission?
                               [Fiona]Yeah, more or less.
                               [Mishelle]Then why not get a patent?
                               Wouldn’t a patent make it more difficult to copy island
                               technology and give us legal recourse in the event that
                               the technology is stolen or produced without our permission?
                               [Fiona]I didn’t…I don’t…maybe?
                               [Mishelle]And if Farzon’s technology is so advanced, yet there
                               aren’t any peer reviewed journal studies, do we know
                               if it’s actually more effective?
                               [Fiona]Wha…?
                               [Mishelle]What about…?
                               [Eclair]Everyone’s watching Mishelle completely wreck Fiona.
                               Now’s my chance to sneak out.
                               [Eclair]Okay. I can either bail now, or maybe hide out in the
                               lunchroom.

                               about diapers and babies and immaturity, don’t you?
                               I’ve always wondered: Why is that?
                               [Fiona]I’d explain it to you, but you just wouldn’t understand.
                               You’re too much of a little kid to fully comprehend.

                               they step out onto the docks here. Such a wonderful

                               here? After so long at sea, all I want is some normal
                               food!
                               [Sailor]Life at sea can be lots of fun, but eating so much
                               canned food is only enjoyable for a little while. I don't
                               know who thought canned fish was a good idea...

                               knot. I'm gonna try it on my sister's hair when I get
                               home. It's gonna be great!
                               [Kid]I can't wait to grow up. I wanna travel the world on a

11)  EV: 7 / Pg: 1             [Sailor]*Looks at Eclair's wet tights*Um ... * growl * Disgusting.

11)  EV: 7 / Pg: 2             [Sailor]My old man once sailed on a ship, he said it was the
                               worst mistake he ever made. I think he was just
                               annoyed he wasn't able to play golf on deck.
                               [Sailor]This port has been a popular one for generaions of
                               sailors. I hope one day I can be part of the legacy of

11)  EV: 24 / Pg: 2            [Kid]Do you think there are any pirates left at sea? I've
                               only met the one at the lighthouse, and he didn't even
                               seem like much of a pirate...
                               [Kid]Do they sell Ice cream around here?

11)  EV: 13 / Pg: 2            [Sailor]I love visiting this port. It's so beautiful and the people
                               are lovely.
                               [Sailor]Maybe I'll get some fisihing in before we head off
                               back to port.



11)  EV: 8 / Pg: 1             [Sailor]Uhm ... Did you fall into a puddle or something?

11)  EV: 8 / Pg: 2             [Sailor]This'll be my first time on a boat... I hope I don't get
                               sea-sick...
                               [Sailor]Have you ever been on a boat before?

11)  EV: 14 / Pg: 1            [Painter]*Looks at Eclair's wet tights* My God, children are
                               apparently left to their own devices on this island,
                               it's scary!

11)  EV: 14 / Pg: 2            [Painter]I love to come here sometimes to paint. The world is
                               such an inspirational place and the ocean is the
                               perfect music to make art to.
                               [Painter]Nature is so beautiful. I love the way the waves hug
                               the shore, like a soft stroke on the cheek. As if the
                               tide was reminding it that it would be back soon.

11)  EV: 3 / Pg: 1             [Eclair]I can't enter like that.




11)  EV: 25 / Pg: 3            [Pietr]Where’s Vince?
                               [Eclair]He’s…busy.
                               [Pietr]Uh-huh.
                               [Eclair]You don’t believe me, do you?
                               [Pietr]He’ll talk to me when he’s ready. What can I do for
                               you ladies?
                               [Mishelle]It’s Career Day. Would you mind telling us about
                               your job?
                               [Pietr]*Nods* That’s no problem.
                               The Harbor is the lifeblood of Farazon. It brings tourists
                               and their money to our little slice of paradise.
                               Whatever we can’t make or provide for ourselves,
                               we trade with the Mainland. Simple as that.
                               [Eclair]That’s it?
                               [Pietr]Well there’s some complicated stuff involving transport,
                               but the idea is simple. That’s what’s great about this
                               place. Simple concepts with advanced executions.
                               [Mishelle]Ooooh I like that. Maybe we can work that into our report.
                               [Pietr]Thank you. What did you say your name was, again?
                               [Mishelle]Mishelle.
                               [Pietr]Oh…THAT Mishelle?
                               [Mishelle]What do you mean?
                               [Pietr]Nevermind. It’s not my place to say. Vince will talk to
                               you when he’s ready, too.
                               [Pietr]When you see Vince, tell him I’ll see him when I
                               get home.
                               [Eclair]Oh, he’s not-
                               [Pietr]*shakes head* Just tell him I’ll see him. That’s all.

                               goes crazy for no reason.
                               [Marna]Well no wonder they let you out of school early.
                               [Eclair]Heh heh. Yup. That’s why…
                               [Marna]I haven’t had to send extra clothes to school since you were
                               in preschool. *sighs* What am I going to do with you? Go on
                               up and get changed.
                               [Marna]There’s plenty of clothes and diapers in your dresser.
                               [Eclair]Hmph...Yes, Mom

                               [Marna]How were you supposed to know? You’ve been in charge of
                               changing yourself for years. It’s like you’re going backwards
                               or something. No wonder they sent you home from school early.

                               changed, now.
                               [Marna]Not so fast, little girl. Leaks will happen from time to time,
                               but this is getting ridiculous. Especially if you’re blaming
                               the diaper and not yourself.

                               to get a taste of it.

                               [Marna]Now strip down to your diaper and lay right there, Eclair.

104)  EV: 3 / Pg: 1            [Eclair]Mom, we need to talk.
                               [Marna]Sit down and eat your cereal, dear before it gets all
                               soggy.
                               [Eclair]*Sighs* Fine.
                               [Marna]So, what is it you want to talk about dear?
                               [Eclair]It’s the…the…
                               [Marna]The \iwhat\i, dear?
                               [Eclair]The diapers.
                               [Marna]Are you almost out?
                               [Eclair]What?! No I-
                               [Marna]Because you know it’s your responsibility to tell me
                               when you need more.
                               If you want more privacy, then you can’t expect me to
                               go rooting around in your dresser drawers, counting
                               your briefs.
                               [Eclair]No Mom, that’s not what I mean!
                               [Marna]Well that’s good. The last package I bought from the
                               Sayers’ store was a little thicker than what you usually
                               wear.
                               I thought it might help you if you didn’t have to change
                               as often. They’re not too thick are they?
                               [Eclair]Um…I…well…I guess not?
                               [Marna]Because I can stop by the Sayers while you’re at school
                               today and get the thinner ones if you’d like. I could just
                               slip them right into your dresser for you.
                               [Eclair]First you’re lecturing me about not keeping track of my…
                               of the dia-…of the briefs in my dresser drawer and now
                               you’re offering to go replace them and shove them right
                               into my drawer again!  Which is it?
                               [Marna]Oh my goodness, you’re right, dear. I’m sorry, honey.
                               This is just awkward for me.
                               [Eclair]This is awkward for \iyou\i?
                               [Marna]I know, I know. I was young too, once, believe it or not.
                               Well, you are at that age where you’re not quite an adult,
                               but not quite my little girl anymore.
                               [Eclair]Mom, I woke up this morning and my underwear drawer
                               was filled with disposables! There’s a bin in the bathroom
                               filled with balled up wet diapers!
                               [Marna]…I’m not sure I see your point.
                               [Eclair]Yesterday, I peed my pants, which was weird, but don’t
                               you think replacing all of my panties with adult diapers
                               is a little extreme?
                               [Marna]Eclair, what in the world are you talking about?
                               [Eclair]Last night!
                               [Marna]You mean when you leaked? Honey that’s a little embarrassing,
                               I’ll admit, but you know that sometimes happens. That’s why you
                               always have spare clothes and spare briefs in your backpack.
                               [Eclair]Seriously? Is this seriously happening right now?
                               [Marna]I promise you, the thicker padding is not a punishment.
                               It was complete coincidence. Though now that you
                               mention it, I am a perturbed that you didn’t have any
                               spares with you at the time. Did you run through them
                               all or did you forget to pack them yesterday?
                               [Eclair]Mom, this isn’t making any sense.
                               [Marna]We’re going to have to have a looooong talk about
                               responsibility young lady.
                               Oh, it looks like Vincent and Mishelle are here to walk
                               with you to school. Time to get along and get going.
                               We’ll talk after school.
                               [Eclair]But I don’t wanna go to school! I want to stay here and
                               talk to you! This is weird, Mom!  Really weird!
                               [Eclair]Mom, something very strange is going on here. Would
                               you please stop and listen for just a second?!
                               [Marna]Here’s your backpack, filled with extra briefs just in case.
                               Try to make it to the toilet if you can, obviously, but don’t
                               feel embarrassed if you don’t make it.
                               That’s why you have protection.
                               [Marna]That girl, sometimes. I don’t know what she would do
                               without me.


104)  EV: 9 / Pg: 1            [Eclair]I absolutely need to talk to Mom.


104)  EV: 15 / Pg: 1           [Eclair]Hi Mom! I’m home in time for dinner!
                               [Marna]...
                               [Eclair]How have you been?
                               [Marna]...
                               [Eclair]Something the matter?
                               [Marna]I just got off the phone with your teacher. Is there something
                               you’d like to tell me?
                               [Eclair]Uh…no?
                               [Marna]Well it’s too late. I already know that you skipped school.
                               [Eclair]I couldn’t stay in school! There was so much important
                               stuff to do today!
                               [Eclair]*Sigh* I was hoping you wouldn’t find out about that.
                               [Marna]You’ve got some serious explaining to do, young lady!
                               You skipped out of school!
                               [Eclair]Wait! I can explain! It’s complicated! Weird things have
                               been happening and I had to get out and figure out
                               what was going on.
                               Some things are more important than a single day at  school!
                               [Marna]And did you do any of these really “important” things
                               during school hours?
                               [Eclair]...Maybe
                               [Marna]What do you mean, “maybe”?
                               [Eclair]*Looks back at her backpack* I don’t know if that stuff
                               is important yet because I haven’t gotten a chance to
                               look at it, yet.
                               [Marna]Well then what DID you do during school hours?
                               [Eclair]*Gulps*I got a part time job and I bought some stuff.
                               [Marna]*shakes her head* I am so ashamed of you right now.
                               [Marna]*sniffs* What’s that smell? Is that…is that coming from you?!
                               [Eclair]Wait, I can totally explain that!
                               [Marna]*Taps foot* I’m listening….
                               [Eclair]I was hiding somewhere, and I didn’t want to get up to go poop.
                               [Eclair]Y’know what, it doesn’t sound any better in my head. Nevermind.
                               [Marna]That’s it, I’ve just about run out of patience with you.
                               You’re grounded.
                               [Eclair]Grounded?! But Mom! I’m a nearly an adu-!
                               [Marna]Not right now, you aren’t! And before you can even think
                               about skipping out of this house again, I’ll be taking your
                               pants,little missy!
                               [Marna]Not right now, you aren’t! And before you can even think
                               about skipping out of this house again, I’ll be taking your

                               [Marna]GOTCHA!
                               [Marna]If you’re going to act like some irresponsible little brat,
                               I’m going to treat you like one. You’re in time out, and
                               then you’re going to bed without your dinner.
                               [Eclair](Ugh! No! This is so gross! I’m just… I’m just…sitting
                               in my own…ewwww!  So mushy!)
                               [Marna]And before you even think of it, I’ll have you know that I’ve
                               already raided your closet and taken away anything that
                               could preserve your modesty.
                               If you want to get out of this house, you’ll be prancing
                               through town so that everyone can see you in your diaper.
                               [Eclair]But they’re not diapers! Their inconti-
                               [Marna]Oh, they’re diapers right now! If you act like a little kid,
                               I’m going to call them what little kids call them!
                               [Eclair]*sniff* Can you at least change me?
                               [Marna]What?! Don’t be ridiculous! You change yourself before
                               bed, little missy.

                               [Marna]And before you even think of it, I’ll have you know that I’ve
                               already raided your closet and taken away anything that
                               could preserve your modesty.
                               If you want to get out of this house, you’ll be prancing
                               through town so that everyone can see you in your diaper.
                               [Eclair]But they’re not diapers! Their inconti-
                               [Marna]Oh, they’re diapers right now! If you act like a little kid,
                               I’m going to call them what little kids call them!
                               [Eclair]Hi mom! I’m home from school.
                               [Marna]Welcome home, honey. Is everything alright?
                               [Eclair]Yeah. Fine. Why?
                               [Marna]Is there something you need to tell me?
                               [Eclair]Could you be more specific?
                               [Marna]Your teacher called me today. She told me there was an
                               …incident at school and you were excused.
                               [Eclair]Oh…that...Please don’t be mad.
                               [Marna]Why would I be mad?
                               [Eclair]I peed my pants in front of everyone. Like a…like a baby.
                               [Eclair]Oh…that...I was hoping you wouldn’t find out about that.
                               [Marna]Whatever for? You know you don’t have to keep secrets from me.
                               [Eclair]Really? You told me not to be ashamed of…this.
                               *gestures to her padded behind*.
                               You lock me out of the house so that I’d have to
                               go to school…and then I have a complete breakdown
                               in front of my whole class. You don’t think I’d want to
                               keep that to myself?
                               [Marna]Honey, I’m not mad about that. You couldn’t help that.
                               There was no way you could have predicted that at all.
                               But I am proud that you apparently managed to keep
                               busy the rest of the day. What did you do?
                               [Eclair]You know the usual…went to the library…went to the store.
                               [Marna]And did you have fun?
                               [Eclair]Kinda, yeah.
                               [Marna]Well surely that didn’t take you all day. What else did you do?
                               [Eclair]I went off on a little adventure of my own. Y’know. Spy stuff.
                               [Eclair]Well, I did a little odd jobs, and I happened to run across
                               Marie and her mother.
                               [Marna]Oh?How is Alma, anyway?
                               [Eclair]She’s good. I might be babysitting Marie with Mishelle
                               in a few days.
                               [Marna]Well that’s good news. What else?
                               [Eclair]I think I might have begun to figure out why I’ve been so…
                               off lately. But I’d rather not get into it until I’m more certain.
                               [Marna]Well, as long as you feel the time was well spent and
                               didn’t cause too much mischief with your free time,
                               I’m happy for you.
                               [Eclair]Thanks, Mom. I am just so over today. It’s already older
                               than the internet.
                               [Marna]Well I’m proud of you, anyways. Give me a hug.
                               [Marna]*sniffs* Eclair, honey? Is that smell…? What is that smell?
                               [Eclair]Oh…yeah. I’d rather not get into that.  Is it okay if I skip
                               dinner, take a shower and then go straight to bed?
                               [Marna]Sure honey...sure.
                               [Marna]What has gotten into her lately?
                               [Eclair]Mom, would it be okay if I skipped dinner and just went
                               straight to bed?
                               [Marna]Sure, dear. Go right on ahead.
                               [Marna]That girl…



12)  EV: 16 / Pg: 1            [Marna]Eclair?
                               [Eclair]Hi...
                               [Marna]…
                               [Marna]You’re soaking wet.
                               [Eclair]I know.
                               [Marna]And not from the rain.
                               [Eclair]Yeah. I know.
                               [Marna]You peed your pants.
                               [Eclair]Yeah.
                               [Marna]And you walked all the way home in them?
                               [Eclair]Yes, ma’am.
                               [Marna]What about the supplies I asked you to pick up? Why
                               didn’t you change into those?
                               [Eclair]I didn’t want to pick them up.
                               [Marna]*Sigh* I know. Mrs. Sayers phoned me after you left
                               the store. Which is why I went and got some myself.
                               I am very disappointed in you, young lady.
                               You’re going to learn to get over your pride the HARD WAY.
                               [Eclair]Mom! Don’t!
                               [Marna]I don’t want to hear it!
                               [Eclair]Oooch!
                               [Eclair]Ouch!
                               [Eclair]OOOCH!
                               [Eclair]OW!
                               [Marna]If you won’t take care of yourself like a grown woman,
                               then I’ll just have to take care of you. LEGS UP!
                               [Eclair]*Sniff* I’m sorry!
                               [Marna]Now hold still!
                               [Eclair]EEEEP! Cold! Cold! Cold!
                               [Marna]Quit wriggling, or so help me…!
                               [Eclair]Okay, okay! Sorry! I couldn’t help it.
                               [Marna]Now hold still while I tape you up. *Huff* Never thought
                               I’d have to do THAT again.
                               Now come on. Your dinner’s getting cold.
                               [Eclair]Mom, wait! I can explain!
                               [Marna]Honestly, Eclair. I’m disappointed in you.
                               [Eclair]I don’t know what happened. One minute we were
                               fine, and then we all peed ourselves.
                               [Marna]That’s not what I’m talking about. If Missy Sayers hadn’t
                               called me to tell me about your “I hear my mother calling”
                               stunt, you’d be out of a product you need.
                               [Eclair]But I don’t -!
                               [Marna]You walked home in wet pants!
                               [Eclair]I’m not a baby!
                               [Marna]Oh really? If a baby wet their pants, would they take care
                               of it themselves, or would they crawl around in wet pants
                               until a grown up helped them?
                               [Eclair]...
                               [Marna]Would an adult refuse to do a simple errand?
                               [Eclair]...
                               [Marna]You’re not immature because you have a weak bladder
                               and had an accident. You’re immature because you shirked
                               your responsibility and did nothing to help fix it, yourself.
                               Bad things are going to happen to you as you grow up.
                               How you deal with them is what makes you mature or
                               not.
                               You have to have change the things you can, accept the
                               things you can’t, and have the wisdom to know the
                               difference.
                               [Eclair]...Hmmph
                               [Marna]What’s going to happen to you when you wet the bed
                               at college? Are you just goijng to let the sheets soak
                               until someone else changes them for you?
                               [Eclair]I! DO! NOT! WET! THE! BED!
                               [Marna]Eclair...
                               [Eclair]Sorry.
                               [Marna]I think it’s time for you to go to bed.
                               [Eclair]Yes Mommy.

12)  EV: 7 / Pg: 2             [Marna]If I didn’t know any better I’d say you’re trying to avoid
                               going to school. Now hurry up or you’ll be late!
                               Or do you WANT to keep talking to me about your
                               nighttime accidents?
                               [Eclair]But I don’t have accidents!
                               [Marna]What was that this morning, then? An on purpose?
                               [Eclair]I mean normally!  I just…it’s just…Ummph...

12)  EV: 7 / Pg: 3             [Marna]Before you come home, I’ve placed an order at the
                               store. Would you mind picking it up from Mr. Sayers
                               and bringing it home?
                               [Eclair]*huff* Fine…
                               [Marna]Oh and Eclair?
                               [Eclair]Yes Mother?
                               [Marna]Don’t forget your lunch.
                               [Eclair]Oh yeah, right. Thanks.
                               [Marna]And Eclair?
                               [Eclair]Yeah?
                               [Marna]I love you.

                               [Eclair]Hi...
                               [Marna]…
                               [Eclair]...
                               [Marna]You’re not wearing any pants.
                               [Eclair]I know…
                               [Marna]Is this because of this morning? Is this some kind of
                               a joke? Or rebellion?
                               [Eclair]Not exactly. I kinda had…an accident.
                               [Marna]Oh you poor thing!
                               [Marna]Here, sit down. I’ve got dinner ready. Tell me all
                               about it.
                               [Marna]All three of you?
                               [Eclair]Yeah. Freaky, huh?
                               [Marna]I’ll say. What are the odds? Do you think you were
                               poisoned?
                               [Eclair]Poisoned?
                               [Marna]Well, you have to admit, it’s an awfully big coincidence
                               that all three of you had accidents at the same time in
                               front of that…that…that BULLY.
                               And you did mention that she was calling you babies
                               before you ate lunch.
                               [Eclair]Huh. That is weird, isn’t it?
                               [Marna]I’d bring it up with Miss Georgette tomorrow, if I were you.
                               [Eclair]Maybe I will.
                               [Marna]Regardless, you were put in a bad situation, and you
                               made the best of it. I’m very proud of you
                               [Eclair]You are?
                               [Marna]Of course, Eclair! That accident couldn’t be helped.
                               That’s why it was an accident. But you just rolled with
                               the punches and took care of the mess you were in.
                               That’s a sign of real maturity.
                               [Eclair]Really?
                               [Marna]Sure. Maturity isn’t about acting “grown-up”. Maturity
                               is changing what you can, accepting what you cannot
                               and having the wisdom to know the difference.
                               [Eclair]Thanks, Mom.
                               [Marna]I just have one question.
                               [Eclair]What?
                               [Marna]Why didn’t you think to go buy new pants?
                               [Eclair]*Blushes* I honestly didn’t think to.
                               [Marna]...
                               [Eclair]...
                               [Marna]Heh-heh.
                               [Eclair]Hee-hee-hee.
                               [Marna]Hahahahahaa!
                               [Eclair]Heh-heh. Eh…heh.
                               [Marna]Oh my! Heh-heh. Oh dear. What am I ever going to do
                               with you, Eclair?
                               [Eclair]I don’t know. Gosh, I was so embarrassed.
                               [Marna]Oh, you’re young yet. This too shall pass. If you want,
                               tomorrow, you can blame me. Say that you did it as a
                               way to try and embarrass me, or as a prank or something.
                               [Eclair]Seriously? You don’t mind being the bad guy?
                               [Marna]Not this time. You’re my daughter. Just because you’ve
                               got a bed wetting problem and a weak bladder doesn’t
                               mean I want you to be publicly humiliated.
                               [Eclair]I do not have a…! *Sigh* Thanks Mom. I’m going to go
                               to bed. It’s been a long and crazy day.
                               [Marna]Oh, and Eclair?
                               [Eclair]Yeah?
                               [Marna]Since you’re already…wearing…maybe you could try
                               going to bed with one on? Just this once? You might
                               like waking up with dry sheets.
                               [Eclair]…! *Huff* Yes, Mother.


12)  EV: 8 / Pg: 2             [Marna]Take a sit Eclair, we need to talk.

12)  EV: 3 / Pg: 1             [Eclair]I definitely can't go outside like that
                               [Eclair]I should talk to mom.


12)  EV: 9 / Pg: 1             []A power bar…a glass of juice…and instant breakfast
                               of champions.


12)  EV: 15 / Pg: 1            [Marna]Eclair?
                               [Eclair]Hi...
                               [Marna]…
                               [Marna]You’re soaking wet.
                               [Eclair]I know.
                               [Marna]And not from the rain.
                               [Eclair]Yeah. I know.
                               [Marna]You peed your pants.
                               [Eclair]Yeah.
                               [Marna]And you walked all the way home in them?
                               [Eclair]Yes, ma’am.
                               [Marna]What about the supplies I asked you to pick up? Why
                               didn’t you change into those?
                               [Eclair]I was embarrassed.
                               [Marna]More embarrassed than walking home with
                               pee-stained pants?
                               If you had been in a clean incontinence brief, you could
                               have at least played it off as a joke? There’s no faking
                               that smell.
                               [Eclair]When you put it that way…
                               [Marna]*Sigh* Come on, honey. This is going to be embarrassing
                               for both of us, but it’s time to get over your fear.
                               [Marna]Lie down, Eclair.
                               [Eclair]Do I have to? I’ve got clean panties here.
                               [Marna]This is to teach you a lesson. We’ll worry about what
                               underwear you wear during the day, tomorrow. Now
                               hold still, and legs up.
                               [Eclair]Wooooo! Cold! Cold! Cold!
                               [Marna]Sorry, hon. Should’ve worn you about the wipes. Now
                               hold still, I’m almost done.
                               [Eclair]Yes ma’am.
                               [Marna]Well, it’s been a while, and it’s a few more tapes than
                               I remember, but I’ve still got it. Now come on. Let’s eat
                               dinner, and you can tell me all about what happened.
                               [Marna]So all three of you peed your pants at the same time?
                               [Eclair]Yes ma’am.
                               [Marna]Hmmm, that’s a little strange, even with all three of
                               your weak bladders. Maybe it was sympathetic. One
                               of you started and then the rest of you started.
                               [Eclair]But-
                               [Marna]Did any of you remember to take frequent bathroom
                               breaks?
                               [Eclair]No, but-
                               [Marna]What about Michelle  and Vincent? Did they have any
                               “just-in-case” clothes?
                               [Eclair]They just ran off.
                               [Marna]*Sighs* Ah you kids. What are you going to do without
                               your parents?
                               [Eclair]Hey!
                               [Marna]I hope you at least go to different colleges on the
                               mainland. You’re all too old for more of your little
                               “soggy slumber parties”.
                               [Eclair]MOM!
                               [Marna]Sorry, dear. *chuckles* Sorry. What I don’t understand
                               is why didn’t you at least put on a brief since you had
                               access to them?  Why were you so embarrassed?
                               [Eclair]Fiona was there. I didn’t want to look like a baby any
                               more than I already did.
                               [Marna]Oh honey, who cares about what Fiona thinks? Do
                               you even like her?
                               You have a genuine medical issue, and you needed
                               a little extra protection. That’s it.
                               [Eclair]Mom, I wet my pants and you’re saying I should’ve
                               just put on a diaper.
                               [Marna]You’re not wearing a diaper. It’s an incontinence brief.
                               [Eclair]You taped this thing on me, and then I heard you say
                               “I’ve still got it.” How much experience do you have
                               changing incontinence briefs?
                               [Marna]I guess I kind of got a little carried away there, didn’t I?
                               It’s hard for parents to see that their children are going
                               up in front of them.
                               [Eclair]But I don’t have…I mean I didn’t before-!
                               [Marna]Now, now. I’m not going to have the same discussion.
                               You can say whatever you want, but that’s not going to
                               change years and years of memoires, is it?
                               [Eclair](This is soooooo frustrating! Why am I the only one
                               who remembers things differently?)
                               [Marna]All I’ll say is this. Maturity isn’t about what you wear or
                               what you look like or what other people think of you.
                               Maturity is being put into a bad situation and handling
                               it with dignity and sense.
                               It’s about changing what you can, accepting what you
                               can’t, and being wise enough to know the difference.
                               [Eclair]I guess that makes sense. So it would’ve been more
                               mature of me to put on a dry diaper?
                               [Marna]Almost anything would have been more mature than
                               walking home in wet pants so that everyone could see
                               you. I’ll admit though, that’s a bit of a tough call.
                               At least you were mature enough to run that errand for
                               me, even if it was a little embarrassing for you.
                               [Eclair]Thanks, I guess. So don’t freak out, and keep your
                               cool. Is that why you made me wear one of these…
                               things… to the dinner table?
                               [Marna]That…and I forgot how cute you looked with a padded
                               tushie.
                               [Eclair]Mom!
                               [Marna]Sorry, I just got nostalgic. Seeing you like that reminds
                               me of when you really were little.*Sigh* I should have
                               had another.
                               Oh well, just don’t make me a grandmother anytime
                               soon.
                               [Eclair]No need to worry about that, Mom.
                               [Marna]Okay, off to bed. You’ve had a long day.  You need your
                               rest.
                               [Eclair]Can I at least take this off? I think I’ve learned my lesson.
                               [Marna]I don’t know that you have. Off to bed. We’ll discuss
                               what underwear you’re wearing tomorrow. Keep that
                               on for the time being. No sense in wasting it.
                               [Eclair]Eww!
                               [Marna]Not what I mean. Just wear it tonight, just-in-case.
                               [Eclair]*Huff* Yes ma’am.

12)  EV: 10 / Pg: 1            [Marna]So, Eclair, I’ve been thinking.
                               [Eclair]About?
                               [Marna]College.
                               [Eclair]What about college? I’ve already got a scholarship
                               for next year.
                               [Marna]I just wanted to bring it up now, first thing in the
                               morning before you had any potential…accidents…
                               that might affect your mood.
                               [Eclair]Mom, what in the world are you talking about?
                               [Marna]*sigh* Eclair, you’re my daughter, and I will always love
                               you, but you’re going to want a place of your own when
                               you’re a bit older.
                               Soon you won’t want things like your mother waking
                               you up before school so she can change your wet
                               bedsheets.
                               [Eclair]I am \iso\i confused right now.
                               [Marna]Don’t interrupt, dear. You’ve just…had this
                               little problem for a long time, and I don’t think it’s
                               going away anytime soon.
                               [Eclair]\iWhat\i problem?
                               [Marna]And that’s okay. A lot of people wet the bed,
                               but they don’t all have their mothers around to clean
                               up after them.
                               [Eclair]This is the first time it’s happened since,
                               like, forever!
                               [Marna]Are you embarrassed?
                               [Eclair]Uh..yeah…kind of!
                               [Marna]Well good. It wouldn’t be quite normal if you
                               weren’t at least a little embarrassed at your age.
                               The fact that you shooed me out of your room while
                               you got dressed shows that you’re maturing.
                               [Eclair]????
                               [Marna]My point being, that maybe you could start wearing
                               some…ahem…protection to bed when you go to
                               sleep at night.
                               Help protect the mattress. It’d be less work for me.
                               And when you start living away from home, and you
                               don’t have to worry about getting a plastic sheet or

                               come change your wet sheets for you, do you?
                               It just might be easier if you wore a little something
                               more…absorbent to bed.
                               [Eclair]I wet the bed…one time…and you want me to wear
                               diapers?!

                               diapers when they’re for adults.

                               you’re talking about.  If this is some kind of joke or

                               [Glenn]Did you ever think to ask? On the more practical side,
                               we like to keep some of our more high tech advances
                               a secret.
                               We grow more than enough food for the whole island,
                               including tourists, and can sell top of the line products
                               to the mainland at a profit.
                               [Eclair]What does that have to do with practicality?
                               [Glenn]People love the food, but don’t have a way to replicate
                               the quality, technology, or even the speed at which the
                               plants grow.
                               This corn was planted just last month and it’s already
                               near the point of harvest.
                               [Vince]Again, how is it practical not to share?
                               [Glenn]If the mainland knew about this, they might find a way
                               to copy it, or worse, steal it. A cup of this soil is worth
                               more than thirty times its weight in gold.
                               Then we’d be out of a source of income that we use
                               to trade for the few supplies that we can’t create on
                               the island.
                               [Mishelle]And?
                               [Glenn]You can’t copy or steal what you don’t know about.
                               [Eclair]Point taken. Can the nanites do more than just tear
                               stuff down?
                               [Glenn]Like what?
                               [Eclair]I noticed that there’s no tractor or plow on the farm.
                               [Glenn]Clever girl. A few commands sent on the old IA and I
                               can send a signal to the nanites in the soil to plant
                               any seed that I drop.
                               [Vince]Nice!
                               [Glenn]Yeah, somedays I’m more of a nano-technician than
                               a traditional farmer. Still, it all works out.








87)  EV: 13 / Pg: 1            [Carmella]Please, don't tell my father.

87)  EV: 13 / Pg: 2            [Carmella]Shhhh…my Dad is looking for me. Don’t let him know
                               I’m here.
                               [Eclair]He already knows, Carmella.
                               [Carmella]Well…I…I…well, crap. Still, don’t tell him you found
                               me, but you heard me giggling or something.
                               [Eclair]Huh? Why?
                               [Carmella]Running out the clock. If he thinks I’m playing around
                               in here-
                               [Vince]Which you are.
                               [Carmella]- then he’ll know that I’m safe but won’t come in looking
                               for me.
                               [Mishelle]Why don’t you want him looking for you?
                               [Carmella]He wasn’t too happy when he heard about what happened
                               over at the mines. By the time I go back inside, he’ll be too
                               tired to yell at me.
                               [Eclair]Isn’t that a little immature?
                               [Carmella]Yeah, maybe. But I can get away with it, so why not?
                               [Carmella]Simple misdirection. If he thinks I’m playing around
                               in here-
                               [Vince]Which you are.
                               [Carmella]-Then he won’t notice when I leave.
                               [Mishelle]Where would you be going to?
                               [Carmella]Wouldn’t you like to know? *Wink*

32)  EV: 23 / Pg: 2            [Gamer Boy]I LOVE video games! I bought this hat at the airport on
                               the way here. They had all kinds of Anime stuff, but I
                               really wanted this hat so i could look like my hero!
                               [Gamer Boy]Have you seen my friend? He's super short, yellow
                               and he makes noises that rhyme with "Chica!"

                               [Old Man]You remind me of my daughter. She's a bit older than
                               you I think, but she has such warm eyes like you do.

32)  EV: 24 / Pg: 2            [Traveler]Hi there! I'm here for a few weeks, but I wish I could
                               stay forever. I've never seen such wonderful
                               weather!

32)  EV: 35 / Pg: 2            [Eclair]Alright. Well now that I’ve got that business taken care
                               of, what to do next. It’s still a little early to go home, yet.
                               But there’s no chance I’m going back to school.
                               [Eclair]Maybe I could go hang with Granny Vincenzia for a little
                               bit. She’s always got some cookies to eat at least.
                               [Eclair]He!We all ate the cookies the same day we wet our pants!
                               [Eclair]What if Granny had something to do with it? Maybe that’s
                               why she encouraged us to go bother Ranger Michael.
                               [Eclair]She knew we were going to wet our pants and wanted us out
                               of her house before we made the connection! But Ranger
                               Michael was acting kind of fishy too, come to think of it.
                               [Eclair]He really didn’t want us to go into that old mine.  And there
                               were those strange carvings on the wall. Why didn’t he
                               want us to see that?
                               [Eclair]Maybe I should investigate one of them? I probably only
                               have time for one of them.
                               [C.S.]Looks like someone is playing detective.
                               [L.R.]Heh, heh, heh. “The Padded P. I.” Nice. Sounds like

                               []\iIt happens. Her body, unable to withstand it any longer,
                               lets loose, and a strange, warm, wet, almost alien
                               sensation invades her underwear.\i
                               \iThe warmth spreads quickly, caressing and encasing

                               [L.R.]That was a one in-a-million shot!

                               [Miss Georgette]Not at that level it hasn’t .*Hugs Eclair* This is turning

                               situation on our hands. If I may have a word with you
                               on stage left, I’ll explain.

                               [Eclair](Oh no! Please don’t! Not right now!)
                               [Eclair]Fiona! Open up! I need to go! Now!
                               [Fiona]Why…ugh…do you care? You’ve got a diaper on, you
                               immature little…ugh!
                               [Eclair]Fiona! I’m begging you, please! Don’t make me wet
                               my pants!
                               [Fiona]Okay…*pant* *pant* ugh…fine…I’ll be the bigger woman.
                               I think the worst is over, anyways. I’m coming out.
                               [Eclair]Come on! Get out of there! Hurry!
                               [Fiona]I…I can’t!

                               YOU’RE STUCK?!
                               [Fiona]There’s some kind of glue or something that’s keeping
                               me stuck to the seat.
                               [Maxwell]*gasps* Oh no!
                               [Carmella]This wasn’t supposed to happen like \ithis\i!
                               [Georgette and Ronald]What wasn’t to happen?!
                               [Maxwell and Carmella]Nothing!
                               [Eclair]PLEASE, FIONA! GET OUT BEFORE I…I…!
                               []\iIt happens. Her body, unable to withstand it any longer,
                               lets loose, and a strange, warm, wet, almost alien
                               sensation invades her underwear.\i
                               \iThe warmth spreads quickly, caressing and encasing
                               her most intimate of areas. Eclair cannot deny it any
                               longer: She’s done the unthinkable; this time in front\i
                               \iof so many more witnesses than just Fiona. But the expected
                               catharsis- the hot humiliation of urine trickling down her legs
                               and pooling into a puddle on the floor- never comes.\i
                               \iInstead, it all stays with her. The weight of her shame
                               already begins to take shape and form as the diaper
                               swells and sags ever so slightly between her legs.\i
                               \iAnd worse yet, Eclair realizes in the back of her mind: it
                               doesn’t feel all that bad in comparison to what happened
                               yesterday.\i
                               \iIt’s rather like slipping into a warm bath if she didn’t think
                               about it too much.\i
                               [Eclair]NO! PLEASE! NOT THIS! PLEASE NOT THIS!  NOT
                               NOW! NOT IN FRONT OF ALL MY FRIENDS!
                               [L.R.]Holy shit! Are you saying that you gave the farm
                               girls the idea to prank the bully just so our target would
                               get locked out of the bathroom at the right time?
                               [C.S.]You got it.
                               [L.R.]And you didn’t press any reality altering buttons?
                               [C.S.]The only button I pressed was “Send”.
                               [L.R.]That was a one in-a-million shot!
                               [C.S.]And that’s how you play the game, buddy.
                               [L.R.]That’s crazy that it worked!
                               [C.S.]Crazy like a fox.
                               [L.R.]If you had bet me that was how it was going to
                               play out, I would have lost a whole lot of money
                               right now.
                               [C.S.]Damn…I hadn’t thought of that.
                               [Miss Georgette]Eclair! What’s the matter, sweetie? Are you okay?
                               [Eclair]*sniffs* No. I’m not okay. Nothing’s going right today,
                               everything sucks. And now I…I…I just want my…my...I
                               don’t want to be here!
                               [Miss Georgette]Awww, you poor thing.*Hugs Eclair* Today is just not
                               your day, is it? How about I give you the rest of the day
                               off?
                               [Eclair]Okay!
                               [Miss Georgette]Eclair! Are you alright?
                               [Eclair]*sniffs* I’m fine, I guess. I’m just really, really,
                               embarrassed is all. That’s never happened before.
                               [Miss Georgette]Not at that level it hasn’t .*Hugs Eclair* This is turning
                               out to be a strange day for everyone. Would you like to
                               take the rest of the day off?
                               [Eclair]*nods* Yes, ma’am.
                               [Carmella, Mishelle, Maxwell and Vince]Hooray!

                               me get Fiona unstuck.
                               [Maxwell and Carmella]Why us?!
                               [Ronald]Oh, I think you know why.
                               [Carmella]Told you we shouldn’t have followed that anonymous
                               email’s suggestion.

                               sister. Otherwise I’d be \ireally\i mad.
                               [Carmella]Huh? What does me being Maxwell’s sister have to
                               do with anything? You hang out with me, remember?
                               [Eclair]You didn’t have to do that, Carmella.
                               [Carmella]I know, but you’re my friend. I just wanted today to be
                               better than yesterday.
                               [Eclair]In a really round about way, you got me the rest of the
                               day off. So there’s that.
                               [Carmella]I never thought about it like that.
                               [Eclair]And yesterday wasn’t so bad, either. Those weird drawings
                               in the mines were kinda cool.
                               [Carmella]Huh? How’d you know about that? You stayed at school
                               yesterday when I skipped.

                               the upgrading of technology here on the island.

                               bet he could give you a run for your money.

                               [Eclair]But we’ve never even been sick.
                               [Karlton]Well that’s probably because of all the immunity
                               boosters and vaccines that are in the drinking water
                               and food.

                               [Karlton]For us it is.
                               [Eclair]Does the rest of the world still poke people with
                               diseased needles?
                               [Karlton]Oh Logic, no. Most vaccinations are done with
                               hypo-sprays and inhalants.
                               Humanity has come a long way from scratching the
                               skin with cowpox needles and the like. We’re just a
                               little ahead of the curve and put it into our food.
                               [Vince]Not to be rude, but that makes you a medical
                               doctor how?
                               [Karlton]Well I do have a near encyclopedic knowledge of
                               everyone on the islands’ medical conditions. For example,
                               all three of you have chronic nocturnal enuresis.

                               [Karlton]Not to worry children, we still have doctor patient
                               confidentiality. No one needs to know who doesn’t
                               already.

                               a power plant?
                               [Karlton]*snorts* Oh that’s quite simple, really. The roof on
                               every building is actually a very sophisticated solar panel.
                               [Eclair]But they don’t look like the solar panels in our
                               science books.
                               [Karlton]I said they were sophisticated, didn’t I? Now children,
                               I really have to get back to work on fixing my…uh…
                               invention here. The mayor is waiting on this.
                               Go bother some other adult.
                               [L.R.]Now?
                               [C.S.]I said not yet! Do you want all of that sensitive
                               equipment to get peed on?
                               [L.R.]…Kinda….

                               Then I might be able to stop the containment leak in
                               the asymmetrical phaser sensors…but that would
                               crumple the dorsal parabolic resonance engine.

                               on me! I’m working on something very delicate here.
                               [Eclair]Would you mind answering some questions for us

                               that we could understand anyway.
                               [Vince]Yeah, Karlton is either a genius or a nut.
                               [Mishelle]Can’t he be both?

                               the harm, personally. Though if you’re playing hookie,
                               your mother might feel differently.
                               [Eclair]Eeeep! Please don’t tell her!
                               [Alma]I wasn’t even thinking of that.  Although, now that you mention it…
                               [Eclair]Oh no! Please! I got the day off from my teacher, I swear!
                               [Alma]Are you sure your mother will believe that?
                               [Eclair]I…hope so?
                               [Eclair]She’ll have to! It’s the truth!

                               [Eclair]…
                               [Alma]I could tell your mother, unless…
                               [Eclair]Unless? Unless what?!
                               [Alma]I’m going out in a few nights with some old friends
                               from the mainland.
                               [Marie]Oh no...!
                               [Alma]I was going to have Mishelle sit with Marie. Perhaps
                               you’d care to join her and watch Marie while I’m gone?
                               Then we’ll call it even and I won’t tell your mother.
                               [Eclair]Deal!
                               [Marie]Nooooo!
                               [Eclair]Hey! What’d I do?
                               [Alma]Marie, what’s wrong? I thought you liked Eclair.
                               [Marie]I do. Eclair’s really cool.
                               [Alma]Then what’s the matter?
                               [Eclair]Yeah, it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve babysat you.
                               [Marie]But I’m not some little kid, anymore. I should be
                               babysitting by now. Not being babysat.
                               [Eclair]I can kinda see your point. I was about your age when
                               Mishelle and I started looking after you.
                               [Marie]See, Mom? I wanna take care of babies and change
                               diapers, not get watched by someone who is still in
                               them.
                               [Alma]Marie! Manners!
                               [Marie]No offense, Eclair.

                               [Alma]I know you’re a very mature and responsible girl, Marie.
                               It just helps me to know that your big sister and her
                               friend, medical issues or not, are looking after you.
                               You’ll get to be the big and responsible one someday soon.
                               I promise.
                               [Eclair]Is there anything I could do to make you feel better, Marie?
                               [Marie]Well….there is one thing.

                               [Marie]Ice cream? I’ve been craving the new double decker

                               [Eclair]Well, I’d love to buy you a treat, but I don’t have any money.
                               I’m doing an odd job for Molly to get some money of my own.

109)  EV: 22 / Pg: 1           [Molly]Like, I’m listening to static compositions. To the untrained,
                               uncool ear, it sounds just like the static between radio waves
                               or a bad transmission; but it’s actually music.
                               Like, you’ve probably never heard of it.

109)  EV: 22 / Pg: 2           [Molly]Like, I found this music mix that randomly mashes up
                               original Top 40 hits and their parodies until you can’t tell
                               where the real one ends and the satire begins.
                               It’s totally ironic. Like, you’ve probably never heard of it.

109)  EV: 22 / Pg: 3           [Molly]Like, it’s the latest thing: Techountry. It’s electronic club
                               pop techno music spliced with Country. It actually makes
                               Country music listenable. “We’re up all night to get lucky
                               riding that bull.” Like, you’ve probably never heard of them.

                               [Molly]Like, I just tuned into this golden oldies podcast. The
                               songs are older than the internet, but they’re way retro.
                               You’ve probably never heard of them.
                               Like, “And we danced all night to the best song ever!”

                               change radically in the span of the next few seconds?

                               already paid to pass out fliers. Like, all those people

                               or a bad transmission; but it’s actually music.

                               [Alma]And why aren’t you at school with her?
                               [Eclair]I had a few…let’s call them “mishaps”. One thing led
                               to another, and now I’m here.
                               [Alma]Well, it’s the last week of school anyways, so I don’t see
                               the harm, personally. Though if you’re playing hookie,
                               your mother might feel differently.

                               [Alma]I wasn’t even thinking of that.  Although, now that you mention it…
                               [Eclair]Oh no! Please! I got the day off from my teacher, I swear!
                               [Alma]Are you sure your mother will believe that?
                               [Eclair]I…hope so?
                               [Eclair]She’ll have to! It’s the truth!
                               [Alma]Are you so sure?
                               [Eclair]…
                               [Alma]I could tell your mother, unless…
                               [Eclair]Unless? Unless what?!
                               [Alma]I’m going out in a few nights with some old friends
                               from the mainland.
                               [Marie]Oh no...!
                               [Alma]I was going to have Mishelle sit with Marie. Perhaps
                               you’d care to join her and watch Marie while I’m gone?
                               Then we’ll call it even and I won’t tell your mother.
                               [Eclair]Deal!
                               [Marie]Nooooo!
                               [Eclair]Hey! What’d I do?
                               [Alma]Marie, what’s wrong? I thought you liked Eclair.
                               [Marie]I do. Eclair’s really cool.
                               [Alma]Then what’s the matter?
                               [Eclair]Yeah, it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve babysat you.
                               [Marie]But I’m not some little kid, anymore. I should be
                               babysitting by now. Not being babysat.
                               [Eclair]I can kinda see your point. I was about your age when
                               Mishelle and I started looking after you.
                               [Marie]See, Mom? I wanna take care of babies and change
                               diapers, not get watched by someone who is still in
                               them.
                               [Alma]Marie! Manners!
                               [Marie]No offense, Eclair.
                               [Eclair]None taken.
                               [Alma]I know you’re a very mature and responsible girl, Marie.
                               It just helps me to know that your big sister and her
                               friend, medical issues or not, are looking after you.
                               You’ll get to be the big and responsible one someday soon.
                               I promise.
                               [Eclair]Is there anything I could do to make you feel better, Marie?
                               [Marie]Well….there is one thing.
                               [Eclair]What?
                               [Marie]Ice cream? I’ve been craving the new double decker

                               I’m doing an odd job for Molly to get some money of my own.

                          <Choices:>  Keep the promise
                          <Choices:>  Break the Promise
                               [Eclair]Okay, squirt. A deal’s a deal.
                               [Marie]Awesome!
                               [Eclair]Let’s go get that ice cream!
                               [Alma]Aren’t you two forgetting something?
                               [Eclair]Like what?
                               [Alma]While you two were negotiating this little bribe, not once
                               did you ask if I was okay with it.
                               [Eclair]Oh yeah…
                               [Marie] Can I, please?
                               [Eclair]Aren’t you forgetting something?
                               [Marie]What?
                               [Eclair]I don’t remember your mother giving you permission.
                               [Marie]Oh yeah…
                               [Marie]Can I, please?
                               [Alma]Hmmmm….come to think of it, this might be a good chance
                               to test how trustworthy and responsible you are Marie.
                               [Marie]It is?
                               [Alma]Eclair, you may take Marie to get some ice cream. Marie,
                               I want you to stay with Eclair until you get there. Once
                               you’re at the shop, I want you to wait for me till I come
                               and pick you up. No wandering off, is that clear?
                               [Marie]Yes, Mom. I’ll be good, I promise.
                               []MARIE JOINS THE PARTY!
                               [Eclair]Yeahhh…I forgot that I needed all of the money for
                               something else. Sorry, I guess…
                               [Eclair]About that…I’m sorry, Marie, but I’m going to have to go back
                               on my word. I really need the money to buy some other things.
                               How about I bring you some ice cream when I come sit with you?
                               [Marie]But you promised! That’s not fair!
                               [Eclair]*Shrugs* It’s just ice cream.
                               [Eclair]I know….I know…sorry. I have some difficult decisions
                               to make, and I’ve made them.  I never should’ve made
                               that promise to you, and that was wrong of me.
                               [Marie]I…I…I….But…I…
                               [Alma]Marie, what’s wrong? I’m sure Eclair will find a way to
                               make it up to you.
                               [Marie]I…I don’t think I’ve ever been this mad before.
                               [Eclair]You’ll get over it.
                               [Eclair]It’ll be alright.
                               [Marie]*Stares daggers at Eclair* I’m not going to forget this.
                               [L.R]How many days before that babysitting job?
                               [C.S]Why?
                               [L.R]Just wanna set my DVR to record that hot mess of a
                               babysitting job with an angry and vengeful pre-teen.
                               [C.S]But reality will have changed again by then.
                               [L.R]And yet I have a distinct feeling a babysitting job will
                               still happen.
                               [C.S]But….aaaaaah. The more things change…
                               [L.R]The more things stay the same. Hey, what are you doing?
                               [C.S]Setting my DVR.
                               [Marie]Any chance that you’ll change your mind?
                               [Eclair]Sorry, but no.
                               [Marie]Can’t blame me for trying.

                               [Eclair]Naw. They’re not so bad once you get used to them.
                               They’re actually kinda comfy.

                               [Alma]Eclair? Oh dear, I am so very sorry. I almost collided
                               into you!
                               [Eclair]I’m okay.
                               [Marie]Hi Eclair! Where’s my sister?
                               [Eclair]She’s still at school.
                               [Alma]And why aren’t you at school with her?
                               [Eclair]I had a few…let’s call them “mishaps”. One thing led
                               to another, and now I’m here.
                               [Alma]Well, it’s the last week of school anyways, so I don’t see
                               the harm, personally. Though if you’re playing hookie,
                               your mother might feel differently.
                               [Eclair]Eeeep! Please don’t tell her!
                               [Alma]I wasn’t even thinking of that.  Although, now that you mention it…
                               [Eclair]Oh no! Please! I got the day off from my teacher, I swear!
                               [Alma]Are you sure your mother will believe that?
                               [Eclair]I…hope so?
                               [Eclair]She’ll have to! It’s the truth!
                               [Alma]Are you so sure?
                               [Eclair]…
                               [Alma]I could tell your mother, unless…
                               [Eclair]Unless? Unless what?!
                               [Alma]I’m going out in a few nights with some old friends
                               from the mainland.
                               [Marie]Oh no...!
                               [Alma]I was going to have Mishelle sit with Marie. Perhaps
                               you’d care to join her and watch Marie while I’m gone?
                               Then we’ll call it even and I won’t tell your mother.
                               [Eclair]Deal!
                               [Marie]Nooooo!
                               [Eclair]Hey! What’d I do?
                               [Alma]Marie, what’s wrong? I thought you liked Eclair.
                               [Marie]I do. Eclair’s really cool.
                               [Alma]Then what’s the matter?
                               [Eclair]Yeah, it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve babysat you.
                               [Marie]But I’m not some little kid, anymore. I should be
                               babysitting by now. Not being babysat.
                               [Eclair]I can kinda see your point. I was about your age when
                               Mishelle and I started looking after you.
                               [Marie]See, Mom? I wanna take care of babies and change
                               diapers, not get watched by someone who is still in
                               them.
                               [Alma]Marie! Manners!
                               [Marie]No offense, Eclair.
                               [Eclair]None taken.
                               [Alma]I know you’re a very mature and responsible girl, Marie.
                               It just helps me to know that your big sister and her
                               friend, medical issues or not, are looking after you.
                               You’ll get to be the big and responsible one someday soon.
                               I promise.
                               [Eclair]Is there anything I could do to make you feel better, Marie?
                               [Marie]Well….there is one thing.
                               [Eclair]What?
                               [Marie]Ice cream? I’ve been craving the new double decker
                               banana split boat over at the ice cream shop.
                               [Eclair]Well, I’d love to buy you a treat, but I don’t have any money.
                               I’m doing an odd job for Molly to get some money of my own.
                               [Marie]Great! You can take me to the ice cream shop AFTER!
                               [Eclair]Well…I don’t know.
                               [Marie]Pleeeeeease! I promise I’ll be really good for you when
                               you come over and sit with me!

                               cream after Molly pays me, but only if you share with me.

                               [Eclair]Nope, nope, nope, nope. Not gonna do it. I need my

                               [Eclair]Yeeeeeah, that’s not gonna work on me. I’ll sit with you
                               and treat you fairly, but I expect you to behave; ice cream

                               never did! How much is the fine?
                               [Derek]This much.

                               [Derek]Oh? How studious of you!
                               [Eclair]I thought I could learn some more useful stuff here.
                               [Derek]*Shrug* Well at least you’re here to learn. Who am I to judge?
                               [Eclair]I’m looking for more information on Dr. Harkness Milner.
                               [Derek]Oh? Heard the older students talking about Career Day,
                               and got curious, is that it?
                               [Eclair]Uh…sure. Let’s go with that.
                               [Derek]Well I just so happen to have a copy of Dr. Harkness Milner’s
                               autobiography and memoirs right here.
                               [Eclair]Oh, can I have it?
                               [Derek]Sure. Let me just look at your library profile.
                               []Derek presses a few keys.
                               [Derek]YIKES!
                               [Eclair]What?
                               [Derek]You’ve got a fine.
                               [Eclair]For what?
                               [Derek]You checked out a book a couple of years ago and never
                               returned it.
                               [Eclair]I did? What book?
                               [Derek]According to this, it was “The Dummy’s Guide To Reverse
                               Psychology: Getting What You Want By Doing The Opposite.”
                               [Eclair]Oh no! I kept saying that I would return that book, but
                               never did! How much is the fine?
                               [Derek]This much.
                               []Derek shows Eclair the fine.
                               [Eclair]I CAN’T AFFORD THAT! That’s more than that book
                               probably costs.
                               [Derek]Sorry, I can’t let you check out a new book until that
                               fine is paid.
                               [Eclair]Where am I gonna get THAT kind of money?
                               [Derek]Tell you what, kiddo, because you’re my little brother’s
                               friend, I can reduce the fine for you.
                               [Eclair]To nothing?
                               [Derek]Pffft…no. But I’ll lower it down to something more manageable.
                               [Eclair]How manageable is manageable?
                               []Derek writes a number down and shows it to Eclair.
                               [Eclair]Okay. Yeah. I could maybe do that. Only one problem.
                               [Derek]What?
                               [Eclair]I don’t have any money on me. Maybe I could work it off?
                               Stock the book shelves or something?
                               [Derek]Sorry, Eclair. But that’s a no go. I hear Molly over at the
                               Cafe is hiring part time help. Maybe you could do an
                               odd job for her to get some money.
